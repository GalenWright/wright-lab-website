The [City of Winnipeg](https://www.tourismwinnipeg.com/), located where the Red and Assiniboine Rivers meet, is recognized for its vibrant, multicultural community and diverse culture. The city, with a growing population of more than 766,000, is home to internationally renowned festivals, galleries and museums, the historic Exchange District and The Forks, and ever-expanding research, education, and business sectors. From the Hudson Bay waters, across the farmland fields, to the pulse of the cities and towns, [The Province of Manitoba's](https://www.travelmanitoba.com/) people and places - its 100,000 lakes, 92 provincial parks, winding river valleys and storied prairie skies - inspire.

### Considerations for selecting the University of Manitoba for graduate studies
The University of Manitoba is one of 15 Canadian public research universities known as the U15. These institutions undertake 80% of Canadian university research activities. Further, the University of Manitoba has an active neuroscience community, which includes the [Manitoba Neuroscience Network (MNN)](https://manitobaneuroscience.ca/). Finally, Winnipeg remains one of the most affordable major cities in the country.
