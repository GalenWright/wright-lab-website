The group welcomed two new graduate students to the group at a lab event at the Forks Market!
- [Lucy Namuli](/author/kevin-lucy-namuli/) will be working on genetic modifiers of repeat expansion disorders using bioinformatic approaches.
- [Paris Musaphir](/author/paris-musaphir/) will be investigating DNA repair pathway choice as a genetic modifier in Rett syndrome using human stem cells.

We are also thankful to have had two undergraduate students working in the lab over the Summer - [Jerni Stewart](/author/jerni-stewart/) (NSERC USRA student) and [Mason Hollebeke](/author/mason-hollebeke/), thank you for all your hard work!
