The group received funding ($130,000) for our new project: <i>Identification of causal genetic variants and genes in neuromuscular disorders</i>. 

We will be using whole genome sequencing paired with gene expression information (RNA-seq) to identify pathogenic mutations in individuals affected by neuromuscular disorders. 

This work is in collaboration with Drs. Patrick Frosk (Clinical Geneticist) and Britt Drögemöller (CRC in <i>Pharamacogenomics and Precision Medicine</i>).
