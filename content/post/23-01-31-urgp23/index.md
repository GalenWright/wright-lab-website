The group received a University of Manitoba Internal Grant ($10,000) for our new project: Population screening of *RFC1* expansions related to an underreported ataxia.

This project aims to establish a genotyping platform for the causative mutation linked to an movement disorder, **C**erebellar **A**taxia, **N**europathy, **V**estibular **A**reflexia **S**yndrome (CANVAS).

This work is in collaboration with Dr. Britt Drögemöller (CRC in Pharamacogenomics and Precision Medicine).
