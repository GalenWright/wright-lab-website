The [Drögemöller](https://www.drogemollerlab.com/), [Kowalec](https://www.kowaleclab.com/) and Wright Labs hosted our first  Annual Joint Precision Genomics Retreat at [FortWhyte Alive](https://www.fortwhyte.org/) in June 2023.

We already hold a joint monthly human genomics club and we used this opportunity to discuss research plans for the coming year, including the arrival of new genomics equipment. It was a great opportunity to brainstorm, perform team building exercises and clear our heads in nature!
