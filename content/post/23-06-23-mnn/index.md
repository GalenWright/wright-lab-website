The lab attended the [Manitoba Neuroscience Network (MNN) Annual Scientific Meeting](https://manitobaneuroscience.ca/events-and-news/annual-scientific-meeting/), which was held at the Leaf in Winnipeg. Since it was a local conference, the entire lab could attend, including our undergraduate students. Alana, Lucy and Paris did a great job presenting their posters and Galen was on the organizing committee. This was the first MNN meeting since the COVID pandemic and it was great to see our colleagues in person!
