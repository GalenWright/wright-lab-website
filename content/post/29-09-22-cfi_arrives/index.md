We are excited that the first pieces of CFI equipment for our **Precision Genomics Suite** have started to arrive! This includes the [Chromium iX](https://www.10xgenomics.com/instruments/chromium-x-series), [Visium CytAssist](https://www.10xgenomics.com/instruments/visium-cytassist) and [Xenium Analyzer](https://www.10xgenomics.com/instruments/xenium-analyzer). We just need to complete a couple of renovations to the room that will house the equipment and look forward to receiving training in the new year.

We are looking forward to generating data off these equipment in 2024!
