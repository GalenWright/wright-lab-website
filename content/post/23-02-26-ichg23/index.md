Exciting news! Members of the Wright Lab, [Alana Slike](/author/alana-slike/) and [Lucy Namuli](/author/kevin-lucy-namuli/), attended and presented at the International Congress of Human Genetics in South Africa. 

Both trainees received travel awards to attend the conference - congratulations! They also presented at the Young Investigators Forum held at the University of Cape Town. 

In between the conference schedule, we were able to visit Table Mountain, and make a trip to see collaborators in Stellenbosch.
