We are excited to announce that [we have received new infrastructure funding](https://news.umanitoba.ca/um-receives-2-5-million-for-research-infrastructure/) from the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) John R. Evans Leaders Fund (JELF)! This funding will be used to develop a Precision Genomics Suite at the university that will allow us to perform extensive genomic studies at the resolution of individual cells.

The Wright Lab is co-principal applicant on this joint work, along with other co-PIs Drs. [Britt Drögemöller](https://www.drogemollerlab.com/) and [Kaarina Kowalec](https://www.kowaleclab.com/). The investment totals $1,328,074 and includes contributions from the CFI ($514,000), Research Manitoba ($513,665), University of Manitoba, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, and vendors.

Parts of our suite will provide new resources for both single cell and spatially-resolved transcriptomics: 
- [Chromium iX (single cell sequencing library preparation)](https://www.10xgenomics.com/instruments/chromium-x-series)
- [Visium CytAssist (prepares Visium spatial slides for spatial sequencing studies)](https://www.10xgenomics.com/instruments/visium-cytassist)
- [Xenium Analyzer (*in situ* spatial studies)](https://www.10xgenomics.com/instruments/xenium-analyzer)

Thank you to our funders for their support. We are looking forward to using this new equipment to perform new neurogenomics studies!
