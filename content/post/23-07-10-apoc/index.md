Congratulations to [Abdoulaye](/author/abdoulaye-diarra) who was selected to attend the Applied Organoid Core Workshop on Generation and Applications of Neural Organoids in Toronto. He received a full travel bursary from the Stem Cell Network! <i class="fa-solid fa-hands-clapping"></i>

See the [course description](https://sites.google.com/view/apoc-organoid-workshop/home): *"aims to provide knowledge dissemination of principles and best practices that will guide workshop applicants in their research pursuits to unravel complex biological questions using organoid-based systems as tools. 
Participants will engage in an intensive and comprehensive four-day session that combines lectures from experts on the broad applications of organoids in discovery research with hands-on experience in the maintenance and propagation of hPSCs in culture, and the generation of neural organoids from stem cells."*

These valuable skills will be applied to projects across the lab!
