[Paris](/author/paris-musaphir) attended two workshops hosted by [bioinformatics.ca](https://bioinformatics.ca/) in Toronto:
- [RNA-seq Analysis](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops-all/2023-rna-seq-analysis/) (3 days)
- [Single Cell RNA-seq Analysis](https://bioinformatics.ca/workshops-all/2023-single-cell-rna-seq-analysis/) (2 days)

The pipelinese that they learned at the workshops will be implemented in their M.Sc. project and will also be helpful for other lab members!
