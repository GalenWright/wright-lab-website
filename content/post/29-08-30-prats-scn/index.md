[Prats](/author/pratyaksh-singhal/) received the [Stem Cell Network Summer Studentship Award](https://stemcellnetwork.ca/stem-cell-network-announces-awardees-of-the-2023-summer-studentships/) to support his work in the lab over the Summer. Notably, he was the only Manitoban student to receive this award! <i class="fa-solid fa-hands-clapping"></i>

As part of this cohort, he was invited to present at the Stem Cell Network Summer Studentship Symposium. He did a great job sharing his research findings!
