Galen was awarded a [Future Leaders in Canadian Brain Research grant](https://braincanada.ca/news/2020futureleaders/): *Investigation of DNA damage response as a genomic modifier in Rett syndrome* Funded by Brain Canada ($100,000). This work was one of 20 projects funded and will allow the lab to investigate genetic modifiers using human stem cells, CRISPR gene editing and genomics!
