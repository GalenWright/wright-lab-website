The group received funding from the CIHR ($70,000) under the catalyst grant program: *Analysis of CLSA Data*.

This grant, *Bioinformatic investigation of previously neglected regions of the genome and their association with age-related hearing loss*, is being led by Dr. Britt Drögemöller and will include the analysis of short tandem repeats and a focused analysis of the X chromosome.
