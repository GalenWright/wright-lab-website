We are excited to share our new collaborative paper, [**A systematic review and analysis of the use of polygenic scores in pharmacogenomics**](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cpt.2520), which was published in *Clinical Pharamcology and Therapeutics*. This article iss the first to comprehensively assess the use of polygenic scores in pharmacogenomics and show the clinical relevance of these scores for drug-related clinical outcomes. This work was led by  Mitacs-Globalink UK-Canada PhD exchange student,
[Danielle Johnson](/author/danielle-johnson/), who was e-visiting (in person visit not possible due to the pandemic) the  in the Drögemöller and Wright labs.
