I am an M.Sc. student in the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics at the University of Manitoba, focusing on computational biology. My undergraduate training was in Biomedical Engineering. I am passionate about seeing the increased application of bioinformatics in low- and middle-income countries. I am interested in the clinical translation of bioinformatics research through the discovery of novel treatments for diseases like malaria and non-communicable diseases that are overwhelming the already strained healthcare system of resource-constrained countries through the use of bioinformatics tools.
