I am a current B.Sc. undergraduate student in Biological Sciences (Cell, Molecular, and Developmental Biology Concentration) at the University of Manitoba. For my project, I will be analyzing properties of genes implicated in pediatric, adult, and diverse-onset neuromuscular disorders through a co-supervision between the Wright and Drögemöller Labs. I am particularly interested in research involving computational biology and bioinformatics approaches, molecular and developmental biology, genomics, genetic testing and gene therapy, and neurodegenerative diseases.
