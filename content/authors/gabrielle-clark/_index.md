In the Wright Lab, I am currently studying CANVAS, an unresolved hereditary late-onset ataxia, employing gene expression data (RNA-seq), quantifying gene expression signatures, producing bioinformatic analyses, using bulk RNA-seq deconvolution software, etc. I'm currently completing my undergraduate degree in genetics. I'm entering my fourth year at the University of Manitoba. My research interests include neurodegenerative disorders and gene therapy.
