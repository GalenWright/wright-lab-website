I am a third-year undergraduate student in the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences at the University of Manitoba. Over the last two summers, I have been working on genetic modifiers of repeat expansion disorders and the genomic characteristics of genes associated with autism spectrum disorders. I am broadly interested in neurodevelopment in child health.
