I started as an Assistant Professor at the University of Manitoba in April 2020 and am currently a Canada Research Chair in *Neurogenomics*. I am also a principal investigator at the PrairieNeuro Research Centre in the Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg and a research scientist at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital Foundation of Manitoba (CHRIM). I completed my Ph.D. in Genetics at Stellenbosch University and received additional training in computational biology at the South African National Bioinformatics Institute. I then conducted a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of British Columbia, where my research investigated drug-induced neurotoxicities and genetic modifiers of Huntington disease.

**Select awards:**
- Tier 2 Canada Research Chair in *Neurogenomics*
