I am a MSc student in the department of Pharmacology at the University of Manitoba.  For my MSc project, I am focusing on DNA repair in the neurodevelopmental disorder, Rett syndrome. I recently graduated from the University of Winnipeg with a B.Sc. (Hons.) in Neuroscience. In my undergraduate thesis I investigated hypothalamic inflammation in aging and Alzheimer’s disease. While I am broadly interested in molecular biology, some specific research interests include neurodegenerative diseases, neurogenomics and precision medicine.
