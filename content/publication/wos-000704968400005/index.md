abstract: 'Background: The current use of ribavirin in difficult-to-cure chronic hepatitis
  C patients (HCV) and patients with severe respiratory infections is constrained
  by the issue of ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia that affects 30% of treated patients,
  requiring dosage modification or discontinuation. Though some genetic variants have
  been identified predicting this adverse effect, known clinical and genetic factors
  do not entirely explain the risk of ribavirin-induced anemia. Methods: We assessed
  the associations of previously identified variants in inosine triphosphatase (ITPA),
  solute carrier 28A2 (SLC28A2) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes with ribavirin-induced
  anemia defined as hemoglobin decline of >= 30 g/L on treatment, followed by a staged
  discovery (n = 114), replication (n = 74), and combined (n = 188) genome-wide association
  study to uncover potential new predictive variants. Results: We identified a novel
  association in the gene coding glycophorin C (rs6741425; OR:0.12, 95% CI:0.04-0.34,
  P = 2.94 x 10(-6)) that predicts protection against ribavirin-induced anemia. We
  also replicated the associations of ITPA and VDR genetic variants with the development
  of ribavirin-induced anemia (rs1127354; OR:0.13, 95%CI:0.04-0.41, P = 8.66 x10(-5);
  and rs1544410; OR:1.65, 95%CI:1.01-2.70, P = 0.0437). Conclusions: GYPC variation
  affecting erythrocyte membrane strength is important in predicting risk for developing
  ribavirin-induced anemia. ITPA and VDR genetic variants are also important predictors
  of this adverse reaction.'
