 abstract = {Background: The current use of ribavirin in difficult-to-cure chronic
hepatitis C patients (HCV) and patients with severe respiratory
infections is constrained by the issue of ribavirin-induced hemolytic
anemia that affects 30% of treated patients, requiring dosage
modification or discontinuation. Though some genetic variants have been
identified predicting this adverse effect, known clinical and genetic
factors do not entirely explain the risk of ribavirin-induced anemia.
Methods: We assessed the associations of previously identified variants
in inosine triphosphatase (ITPA), solute carrier 28A2 (SLC28A2) and
vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes with ribavirin-induced anemia defined as
hemoglobin decline of >= 30 g/L on treatment, followed by a staged
discovery (n = 114), replication (n = 74), and combined (n = 188)
genome-wide association study to uncover potential new predictive
variants.
Results: We identified a novel association in the gene coding
glycophorin C (rs6741425; OR:0.12, 95% CI:0.04-0.34, P = 2.94 x 10(-6))
that predicts protection against ribavirin-induced anemia. We also
replicated the associations of ITPA and VDR genetic variants with the
development of ribavirin-induced anemia (rs1127354; OR:0.13,
95%CI:0.04-0.41, P = 8.66 x10(-5); and rs1544410; OR:1.65,
95%CI:1.01-2.70, P = 0.0437).
Conclusions: GYPC variation affecting erythrocyte membrane strength is
important in predicting risk for developing ribavirin-induced anemia.
ITPA and VDR genetic variants are also important predictors of this
adverse reaction.},
