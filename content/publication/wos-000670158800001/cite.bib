 abstract = {Depression during pregnancy affects 10-15% of women, and 5% of women
take antidepressants during pregnancy. Clinical guidelines provide
recommendations for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drug
choice and dose based on CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotype; however, they are
based on evidence from non-pregnant cohorts. This study aimed to test
the hypothesis that women with function-altering variants (increased,
decreased, or no function) in these pharmacogenes, taking SSRIs
prenatally, would have more depression symptoms than women whose
pharmacogenetic variants are associated with normal SSRI metabolism.
Comprehensive CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotyping using a range of methods,
including gene copy number analysis, was performed as secondary analyses
on two longitudinal cohorts of pregnant women (N?=?83) taking the SSRIs
paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, or sertraline. The Kruskal-Wallis
test compared mean depression scores across four predicted metabolizer
groups: poor (n?=?5), intermediate (n?=?10), normal (n?=?53), and
ultrarapid (n?=?15). There were no significant differences between mean
depression scores across the four metabolizer groups (H(3)?=?.73,
p?=?.87, eta-squared?=?.029, epsilon-squared?=?.0089). This is the first
study of the relationship in pregnancy between CYP2C19 pharmacogenetic
variations and depression symptoms in the context of SSRI use. Findings
from this initial study do not support the clinical use of
pharmacogenetic testing for SSRI use during the second or third
trimesters of pregnancy, but these findings should be confirmed in
larger cohorts. There is an urgent need for further research to clarify
the utility of pharmacogenetic testing for pregnant women, especially as
companies offering direct-to-consumer genetic testing expand their
marketing efforts.},
