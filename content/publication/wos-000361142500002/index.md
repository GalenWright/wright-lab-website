abstract: "To align predicted and measured CYP2C19 phenotype in a South African cohort.\
  \ Materials & methods: Genotyping of CYP2C19*2, *3, *9, *15, *17, *27 and *28 was\
  \ performed using PCR-RFLP, and an activity score (AS) system was used to predict\
  \ phenotype. True phenotype was measured using plasma concentrations of omeprazole\
  \ and its metabolite 5'-hydroxyomperazole. Results: Partial genotype-phenotype discrepancies\
  \ were reported, and an adapted AS system was developed, which showed a marked improvement\
  \ in phenotype prediction. Results highlight the need for a more comprehensive CYP2C19\
  \ genotyping approach to improve prediction of omeprazole metabolism. Conclusion:\
  \ Evidence for the utility of a CYP2C19 AS system is provided, for which the accuracy\
  \ can be further improved by means of comprehensive genotyping and substrate-specific\
  \ modification."
