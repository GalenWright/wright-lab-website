 abstract = {To align predicted and measured CYP2C19 phenotype in a South African
cohort. Materials & methods: Genotyping of CYP2C19*2, *3, *9,
*15, *17, *27 and *28 was performed using PCR-RFLP, and an
activity score (AS) system was used to predict phenotype. True phenotype
was measured using plasma concentrations of omeprazole and its
metabolite 5'-hydroxyomperazole. Results: Partial genotype-phenotype
discrepancies were reported, and an adapted AS system was developed,
which showed a marked improvement in phenotype prediction. Results
highlight the need for a more comprehensive CYP2C19 genotyping approach
to improve prediction of omeprazole metabolism. Conclusion: Evidence for
the utility of a CYP2C19 AS system is provided, for which the accuracy
can be further improved by means of comprehensive genotyping and
substrate-specific modification.},
