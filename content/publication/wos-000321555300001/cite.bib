 abstract = {Background: Rapid advances in high throughput genomic technologies and
next generation sequencing are making medical genomic research more
readily accessible and affordable, including the sequencing of patient
and control whole genomes and exomes in order to elucidate genetic
factors underlying disease. Over the next five years, the Human Heredity
and Health in Africa (H3Africa) Initiative, funded by the Wellcome Trust
(United Kingdom) and the National Institutes of Health (United States of
America), will contribute greatly towards sequencing of numerous African
samples for biomedical research.
Discussion: Funding agencies and journals often require submission of
genomic data from research participants to databases that allow open or
controlled data access for all investigators. Access to such
genotype-phenotype and pedigree data, however, needs careful control in
order to prevent identification of individuals or families. This is
particularly the case in Africa, where many researchers and their
patients are inexperienced in the ethical issues accompanying whole
genome and exome research; and where an historical unidirectional flow
of samples and data out of Africa has created a sense of exploitation
and distrust. In the current study, we analysed the implications of the
anticipated surge of next generation sequencing data in Africa and the
subsequent data sharing concepts on the protection of privacy of
research subjects. We performed a retrospective analysis of the informed
consent process for the continent and the rest-of-the-world and examined
relevant legislation, both current and proposed. We investigated the
following issues: (i) informed consent, including guidelines for
performing culturally-sensitive next generation sequencing research in
Africa and availability of suitable informed consent documents; (ii)
data security and subject privacy whilst practicing data sharing; (iii)
conveying the implications of such concepts to research participants in
resource limited settings.
Summary: We conclude that, in order to meet the unique requirements of
performing next generation sequencing-related research in African
populations, novel approaches to the informed consent process are
required. This will help to avoid infringement of privacy of individual
subjects as well as to ensure that informed consent adheres to
acceptable data protection levels with regard to use and transfer of
such information.},
