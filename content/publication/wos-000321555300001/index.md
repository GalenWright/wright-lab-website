abstract: 'Background: Rapid advances in high throughput genomic technologies and
  next generation sequencing are making medical genomic research more readily accessible
  and affordable, including the sequencing of patient and control whole genomes and
  exomes in order to elucidate genetic factors underlying disease. Over the next five
  years, the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) Initiative, funded by
  the Wellcome Trust (United Kingdom) and the National Institutes of Health (United
  States of America), will contribute greatly towards sequencing of numerous African
  samples for biomedical research. Discussion: Funding agencies and journals often
  require submission of genomic data from research participants to databases that
  allow open or controlled data access for all investigators. Access to such genotype-phenotype
  and pedigree data, however, needs careful control in order to prevent identification
  of individuals or families. This is particularly the case in Africa, where many
  researchers and their patients are inexperienced in the ethical issues accompanying
  whole genome and exome research; and where an historical unidirectional flow of
  samples and data out of Africa has created a sense of exploitation and distrust.
  In the current study, we analysed the implications of the anticipated surge of next
  generation sequencing data in Africa and the subsequent data sharing concepts on
  the protection of privacy of research subjects. We performed a retrospective analysis
  of the informed consent process for the continent and the rest-of-the-world and
  examined relevant legislation, both current and proposed. We investigated the following
  issues: (i) informed consent, including guidelines for performing culturally-sensitive
  next generation sequencing research in Africa and availability of suitable informed
  consent documents; (ii) data security and subject privacy whilst practicing data
  sharing; (iii) conveying the implications of such concepts to research participants
  in resource limited settings. Summary: We conclude that, in order to meet the unique
  requirements of performing next generation sequencing-related research in African
  populations, novel approaches to the informed consent process are required. This
  will help to avoid infringement of privacy of individual subjects as well as to
  ensure that informed consent adheres to acceptable data protection levels with regard
  to use and transfer of such information.'
