abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system treated
  with disease-modifying therapies, including the biologic, interferon-beta (IFN-beta).
  Up to 60% of IFN-beta-exposed MS patients develop abnormal biochemical liver test
  results(1,2), and 1 in 50 experiences drug-induced liver injury(3). Since genomic
  variation contributes to other forms of drug-induced liver injury(4,5), we aimed
  to identify biomarkers of IFN-beta-induced liver injury using a two-stage genome-wide
  association study. The rs2205986 variant, previously linked to differential expression
  of IRF6, surpassed genome-wide significance in the combined two-stage analysis (P
  = 2.3 x 10(-8), odds ratio = 8.3, 95% confidence interval = 3.6-19.2). Analysis
  of an independent cohort of IFN-beta-treated MS patients identified via electronic
  medical records showed that rs2205986 was also associated with increased peak levels
  of aspartate aminotransferase (P = 7.6 x 10(-5)) and alkaline phosphatase (P = 4.9
  x 10(-4)). We show that these findings may be applicable to predicting IFN-beta-induced
  liver injury, offering insight into its safer use.
