abstract: We report an inborn error of metabolism caused by an expansion of a GCA-repeat
  tract in the 5 ` untranslated region of the gene encoding glutaminase (GLS) that
  was identified through detailed clinical and biochemical phenotyping, combined with
  whole-genome sequencing. The expansion was observed in three unrelated patients
  who presented with an early-onset delay in overall development, progressive ataxia,
  and elevated levels of glutamine. In addition to ataxia, one patient also showed
  cerebellar atrophy. The expansion was associated with a relative deficiency of GLS
  messenger RNA transcribed from the expanded allele, which probably resulted from
  repeat-mediated chromatin changes upstream of the GLS repeat. Our discovery underscores
  the importance of careful examination of regions of the genome that are typically
  excluded from or poorly captured by exome sequencing. Three probands with early-onset
  developmental delay had elevated levels of plasma glutamines, which implicated the
  candidate gene GLS, encoding the enzyme glutaminase. However, exome-sequencing analysis
  yielded little to confirm the association. The investigators then used genome sequencing
  and triplet repeat expansion upstream of the GLS coding sequence.
