abstract: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease characterized by myelin
  loss and neuronal dysfunction. Despite the aggregation observed in some families,
  pathogenic mutations have remained elusive. In this study, we describe the identification
  of NR1H3 p.Arg415Gln in seven MS patients from two multi-incident families presenting
  severe and progressive disease, with an average age at onset of 34 years. Additionally,
  association analysis of common variants in NR1H3 identified rs2279238 conferring
  a 1.35-fold increased risk of developing progressive MS. The p.Arg415Gln position
  is highly conserved in orthologs and paralogs, and disrupts NR1H3 heterodimerization
  and transcriptional activation of target genes. Protein expression analysis revealed
  that mutant NR1H3 (LXRA) alters gene expression profiles, suggesting a disruption
  in transcriptional regulation as one of the mechanisms underlying MS pathogenesis.
  Our study indicates that pharmacological activation of LXRA or its targets may lead
  to effective treatments for the highly debilitating and currently untreatable progressive
  phase of MS.
