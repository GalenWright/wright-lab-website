 abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease characterized by
myelin loss and neuronal dysfunction. Despite the aggregation observed
in some families, pathogenic mutations have remained elusive. In this
study, we describe the identification of NR1H3 p.Arg415Gln in seven MS
patients from two multi-incident families presenting severe and
progressive disease, with an average age at onset of 34 years.
Additionally, association analysis of common variants in NR1H3
identified rs2279238 conferring a 1.35-fold increased risk of developing
progressive MS. The p.Arg415Gln position is highly conserved in
orthologs and paralogs, and disrupts NR1H3 heterodimerization and
transcriptional activation of target genes. Protein expression analysis
revealed that mutant NR1H3 (LXRA) alters gene expression profiles,
suggesting a disruption in transcriptional regulation as one of the
mechanisms underlying MS pathogenesis. Our study indicates that
pharmacological activation of LXRA or its targets may lead to effective
treatments for the highly debilitating and currently untreatable
progressive phase of MS.},
