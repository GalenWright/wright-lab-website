abstract: Background Although antipsychotics are integral to the treatment of schizophrenia,
  drug efficacy varies between patients. Although it has been shown that antipsychotic
  treatment response outcomes are heritable, our understanding of the genetic factors
  that are involved remains incomplete. Therefore, this study aims to use an unbiased
  scan of the genome to identify the genetic variants contributing toward antipsychotic
  treatment response outcomes. Materials and methods This study utilized whole-exome
  sequencing of patients on extreme ends of the treatment response spectrum (n=11)
  in combination with results from previous antipsychotic studies to design a panel
  of variants that were genotyped in two well-characterized first-episode schizophrenia
  cohorts (n=103 and 87). Association analyses were carried out to determine whether
  these variants were significantly associated with antipsychotic treatment response
  outcomes. Results Association analyses in the discovery cohort identified two nonsynonymous
  variants that were significantly associated with antipsychotic treatment response
  outcomes (P<2.7x10(-5)), which were also significantly associated with the corresponding
  treatment response outcome in an independent replication cohort. Computational approaches
  showed that both of these nonsynonymous variants - rs13025959 in MYO7B (E1647D)
  and rs10380 in MTRR (H622Y) - were predicted to impair the functioning of their
  corresponding protein products. Conclusion The use of whole-exome sequencing in
  a subset of patients from a well-characterized cohort of first-episode schizophrenia
  patients, for whom longitudinal depot treatment response data were available, allowed
  for (i) the removal of confounding factors related to treatment progression and
  compliance and (ii) the identification of two genetic variants that have not been
  associated previously with antipsychotic treatment response outcomes and whose results
  were applicable across different classes of antipsychotics. Although the genes that
  are affected by these variants are involved in pathways that have been related previously
  to antipsychotic treatment outcomes, the identification of these novel genes will
  play an important role in improving our understanding of the specific variants involved
  in antipsychotic treatment response outcomes. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer
