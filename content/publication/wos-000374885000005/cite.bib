 abstract = {Background Although antipsychotics are integral to the treatment of
schizophrenia, drug efficacy varies between patients. Although it has
been shown that antipsychotic treatment response outcomes are heritable,
our understanding of the genetic factors that are involved remains
incomplete. Therefore, this study aims to use an unbiased scan of the
genome to identify the genetic variants contributing toward
antipsychotic treatment response outcomes.
Materials and methods This study utilized whole-exome sequencing of
patients on extreme ends of the treatment response spectrum (n=11) in
combination with results from previous antipsychotic studies to design a
panel of variants that were genotyped in two well-characterized
first-episode schizophrenia cohorts (n=103 and 87). Association analyses
were carried out to determine whether these variants were significantly
associated with antipsychotic treatment response outcomes.
Results Association analyses in the discovery cohort identified two
nonsynonymous variants that were significantly associated with
antipsychotic treatment response outcomes (P<2.7x10(-5)), which were
also significantly associated with the corresponding treatment response
outcome in an independent replication cohort. Computational approaches
showed that both of these nonsynonymous variants - rs13025959 in MYO7B
(E1647D) and rs10380 in MTRR (H622Y) - were predicted to impair the
functioning of their corresponding protein products.
Conclusion The use of whole-exome sequencing in a subset of patients
from a well-characterized cohort of first-episode schizophrenia
patients, for whom longitudinal depot treatment response data were
available, allowed for (i) the removal of confounding factors related to
treatment progression and compliance and (ii) the identification of two
genetic variants that have not been associated previously with
antipsychotic treatment response outcomes and whose results were
applicable across different classes of antipsychotics. Although the
genes that are affected by these variants are involved in pathways that
have been related previously to antipsychotic treatment outcomes, the
identification of these novel genes will play an important role in
improving our understanding of the specific variants involved in
antipsychotic treatment response outcomes. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters
