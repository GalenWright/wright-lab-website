abstract: 'Aim: Many antipsychotic pharmacogenetics studies have been performed examining
  candidate genes or known variation; however, our understanding of the genetic factors
  involved in antipsychotic pharmacogenetic traits remains limited. Materials & methods:
  A well-characterized cohort of first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients was used
  to identify a subset of nonresponders and responders to antipsychotic treatment
  for exome sequencing (n = 11). The variation observed in the responders and nonresponders
  was subsequently compared and a prioritization strategy was employed to identify
  variants for genotyping in the entire FES cohort (n = 103) as well as an additional
  Xhosa schizophrenia cohort (n = 222). Results: Examination of coding variation revealed
  a potential role for rare loss-of-function variants in treatment response outcomes.
  One variant, rs11368509, was found to be weakly associated with better treatment
  outcomes in the FES cohort (p = 0.057) and the Xhosa schizophrenia cohort (p = 0.016).
  In addition, the majority of the loss-of-function variation that was considered
  likely to be involved in antipsychotic treatment response was either novel or rare
  in Asian and European populations. Conclusion: This pilot study has highlighted
  the importance of exome sequencing for antipsychotic pharmacogenomics studies, particularly
  in African individuals. Furthermore, the results emphasize once again the complexity
  of antipsychotic pharmacogenomics and the need for future research. Original submitted
