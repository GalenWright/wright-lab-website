 abstract = {Aim: Many antipsychotic pharmacogenetics studies have been performed
examining candidate genes or known variation; however, our understanding
of the genetic factors involved in antipsychotic pharmacogenetic traits
remains limited. Materials & methods: A well-characterized cohort of
first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients was used to identify a subset
of nonresponders and responders to antipsychotic treatment for exome
sequencing (n = 11). The variation observed in the responders and
nonresponders was subsequently compared and a prioritization strategy
was employed to identify variants for genotyping in the entire FES
cohort (n = 103) as well as an additional Xhosa schizophrenia cohort (n
= 222). Results: Examination of coding variation revealed a potential
role for rare loss-of-function variants in treatment response outcomes.
One variant, rs11368509, was found to be weakly associated with better
treatment outcomes in the FES cohort (p = 0.057) and the Xhosa
schizophrenia cohort (p = 0.016). In addition, the majority of the
loss-of-function variation that was considered likely to be involved in
antipsychotic treatment response was either novel or rare in Asian and
European populations. Conclusion: This pilot study has highlighted the
importance of exome sequencing for antipsychotic pharmacogenomics
studies, particularly in African individuals. Furthermore, the results
emphasize once again the complexity of antipsychotic pharmacogenomics
and the need for future research. Original submitted 8 July 2013;
