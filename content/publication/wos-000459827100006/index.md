abstract: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major problem in modern medicine, representing
  up to the fourth-highest cause of mortality. Pharmacogenomic tests are 1 of the
  most promising methods to tackle the challenge of ADRs. The objective of this study
  was to analyze the clinical and demographic information of the pan-Canadian active
  surveillance network, Canadian Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug Safety (CPNDS).
  Information entered into the database by trained active surveillors between May
  15, 2005 and May 9, 2017 was collected and analyzed. Specific data included for
  analysis were number of ADR reports, reports of drug use without ADRs, date of onset
  of ADR, suspected drugs, concomitant drugs, and fatal ADR cases. The CPNDS database
  consisted of 93,974 reports of medication use, including 10,475 reports of ADRs,
  of which 72.6% occurred in pediatric patients (21 years old). Self-reported ancestries
  were predominantly Europe (38.2%), Canada (9.6%), and East Asia (4.9%). The 5 most
  frequent ADRs were cutaneous ADRs, peripheral neuropathy, cardiotoxicity, central
  nervous system toxicity, and ototoxicity. The 5 drugs most commonly suspected to
  cause ADRs were methotrexate, vincristine, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and L-asparaginase.
  The CPNDS database is a valuable resource to identify clinical and genomic predictors
  of ADRs. The database also highlights our candidate ADRs for pharmacogenomic discovery
  research to identify additional ADR biomarkers. Additionally, the database provides
  information that can be used for developing strategies to prevent ADRs and raises
  awareness of ADRs among Canadian healthcare professionals.
