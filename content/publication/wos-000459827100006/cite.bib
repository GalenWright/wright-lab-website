 abstract = {Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major problem in modern medicine,
representing up to the fourth-highest cause of mortality.
Pharmacogenomic tests are 1 of the most promising methods to tackle the
challenge of ADRs. The objective of this study was to analyze the
clinical and demographic information of the pan-Canadian active
surveillance network, Canadian Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug Safety
(CPNDS). Information entered into the database by trained active
surveillors between May 15, 2005 and May 9, 2017 was collected and
analyzed. Specific data included for analysis were number of ADR
reports, reports of drug use without ADRs, date of onset of ADR,
suspected drugs, concomitant drugs, and fatal ADR cases. The CPNDS
database consisted of 93,974 reports of medication use, including 10,475
reports of ADRs, of which 72.6% occurred in pediatric patients (21
years old). Self-reported ancestries were predominantly Europe (38.2%),
Canada (9.6%), and East Asia (4.9%). The 5 most frequent ADRs were
cutaneous ADRs, peripheral neuropathy, cardiotoxicity, central nervous
system toxicity, and ototoxicity. The 5 drugs most commonly suspected to
cause ADRs were methotrexate, vincristine, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and
L-asparaginase. The CPNDS database is a valuable resource to identify
clinical and genomic predictors of ADRs. The database also highlights
our candidate ADRs for pharmacogenomic discovery research to identify
additional ADR biomarkers. Additionally, the database provides
information that can be used for developing strategies to prevent ADRs
and raises awareness of ADRs among Canadian healthcare professionals.},
