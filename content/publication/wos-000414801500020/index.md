abstract: 'IMPORTANCE Cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects are an important complication
  that affects testicular cancer survivors as a consequence of treatment. The identification
  of genetic variants associated with this adverse drug reaction will further our
  mechanistic understanding of its development and potentially lead to strategies
  to prevent ototoxic effects. OBJECTIVE To identify the genetic variants associated
  with cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects in adult testicular cancer patients. DESIGN,
  SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective study was performed by the Canadian
  Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug Safety using patients recruited from 5 adult oncology
  treatment centers across Canada. Male patients who were 17 years or older, diagnosed
  with germ cell testicular cancer, and previously treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy
  were recruited from July 2009 to April 2013 using active surveillance methodology.
  Cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects were independently diagnosed by 2 audiologists.
  Patients were genotyped for 7907 variants using a custom pharmacogenomic array.
  Logistic regression was used to identify genetic variants that were significantly
  associated with ototoxic effects. The validity of these findings was confirmed through
  independent replication and cell-based functional assays. EXPOSURES Cisplatin-based
  chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects. RESULTS
  After exclusions, 188 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 31 [24-39] years)
  were enrolled in this study to form the discovery and replication cohorts. Association
  and fine-mapping analyses identified a protein-coding variant, rs4788863 in SLC16A5,
  that was associated with protection against cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects in
  2 independent cohorts (combined cohort: odds ratio, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.02-0.22; P =
  2.17 x 10(-7)). Functional validation of this transporter gene revealed that in
  vitro SLC16A5-silencing altered cellular responses to cisplatin treatment, supporting
  a role for SLC16A5 in the development of cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects. These
  results were further supported by the literature, which provided confirmatory evidence
  for the role that SLC16A5 plays in hearing. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study
  has identified a novel association between protein-coding variation in SLC16A5 and
  cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects. These findings have provided insight into the
  molecular mechanisms of this adverse drug reaction in adult patients with germ cell
  testicular cancer. Given that previous studies have shown that cimetidine, an SLC16A5-inhibitor,
  prevents murine cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects, the findings from this study
  have important implications for otoprotectant strategies in humans.'
