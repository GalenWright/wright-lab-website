 abstract = {IMPORTANCE Cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects are an important
complication that affects testicular cancer survivors as a consequence
of treatment. The identification of genetic variants associated with
this adverse drug reaction will further our mechanistic understanding of
its development and potentially lead to strategies to prevent ototoxic
effects.
OBJECTIVE To identify the genetic variants associated with
cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects in adult testicular cancer patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective study was performed
by the Canadian Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug Safety using patients
recruited from 5 adult oncology treatment centers across Canada. Male
patients who were 17 years or older, diagnosed with germ cell testicular
cancer, and previously treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy were
recruited from July 2009 to April 2013 using active surveillance
methodology. Cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects were independently
diagnosed by 2 audiologists. Patients were genotyped for 7907 variants
using a custom pharmacogenomic array. Logistic regression was used to
identify genetic variants that were significantly associated with
ototoxic effects. The validity of these findings was confirmed through
independent replication and cell-based functional assays.
EXPOSURES Cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects.
RESULTS After exclusions, 188 patients (median [interquartile range]
age, 31 [24-39] years) were enrolled in this study to form the
discovery and replication cohorts. Association and fine-mapping analyses
identified a protein-coding variant, rs4788863 in SLC16A5, that was
associated with protection against cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects in
2 independent cohorts (combined cohort: odds ratio, 0.06; 95% CI,
0.02-0.22; P = 2.17 x 10(-7)). Functional validation of this transporter
gene revealed that in vitro SLC16A5-silencing altered cellular responses
to cisplatin treatment, supporting a role for SLC16A5 in the development
of cisplatin-induced ototoxic effects. These results were further
supported by the literature, which provided confirmatory evidence for
the role that SLC16A5 plays in hearing.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study has identified a novel association
between protein-coding variation in SLC16A5 and cisplatin-induced
ototoxic effects. These findings have provided insight into the
molecular mechanisms of this adverse drug reaction in adult patients
with germ cell testicular cancer. Given that previous studies have shown
that cimetidine, an SLC16A5-inhibitor, prevents murine cisplatin-induced
ototoxic effects, the findings from this study have important
implications for otoprotectant strategies in humans.},
