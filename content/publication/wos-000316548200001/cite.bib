 abstract = {Background: Adverse drug reactions and lack of therapeutic efficacy
associated with currently prescribed pharmacotherapeutics may be
attributed, in part, to inter-individual variability in drug metabolism.
Studies on the pharmacogenetics of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes offer
insight into this variability. The objective of this study was to
compare the AmpliChip CYP450 Test (R) (AmpliChip) to alternative
genotyping platforms for phenotype prediction of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 in a
representative cohort of the South African population.
Methods: AmpliChip was used to screen for thirty-three CYP2D6 and three
CYP2C19 alleles in two different cohorts. As a comparison cohort 2 was
then genotyped using a CYP2D6 specific long range PCR with sequencing
(CYP2D6 XL-PCR + Sequencing) platform and a PCR-RFLP platform for seven
CYP2C19 alleles.
Results: Even though there was a low success rate for the AmpliChip,
allele frequencies for both CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 were very similar between
the two different cohorts. The CYP2D6 XL-PCR + Sequencing platform
detected CYP2D6*5 more reliably and could correctly distinguish
between CYP2D6*2 and *41 in the Black African individuals. Alleles
not covered by the AmpliChip were identified and four novel CYP2D6
alleles were also detected. CYP2C19 PCR-RFLP identified
CYP2C19*9,*15, *17 and *27 in the Black African individuals,
with *2, *17 and *27 being relatively frequent in the cohort.
Eliminating mismatches and identifying additional alleles will
contribute to improving phenotype prediction for both enzymes. Phenotype
prediction differed between platforms for both genes.
Conclusion: Comprehensive genotyping of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 with the
platforms used in this study, would be more appropriate than AmpliChip
for phenotypic prediction in the South African population.
Pharmacogenetically important novel alleles may remain undiscovered when
using assays that are designed according to Caucasian specific
variation, unless alternate strategies are utilised.},
