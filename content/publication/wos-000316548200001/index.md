abstract: 'Background: Adverse drug reactions and lack of therapeutic efficacy associated
  with currently prescribed pharmacotherapeutics may be attributed, in part, to inter-individual
  variability in drug metabolism. Studies on the pharmacogenetics of Cytochrome P450
  (CYP) enzymes offer insight into this variability. The objective of this study was
  to compare the AmpliChip CYP450 Test (R) (AmpliChip) to alternative genotyping platforms
  for phenotype prediction of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 in a representative cohort of the
  South African population. Methods: AmpliChip was used to screen for thirty-three
  CYP2D6 and three CYP2C19 alleles in two different cohorts. As a comparison cohort
  2 was then genotyped using a CYP2D6 specific long range PCR with sequencing (CYP2D6
  XL-PCR + Sequencing) platform and a PCR-RFLP platform for seven CYP2C19 alleles.
  Results: Even though there was a low success rate for the AmpliChip, allele frequencies
  for both CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 were very similar between the two different cohorts.
  The CYP2D6 XL-PCR + Sequencing platform detected CYP2D6*5 more reliably and could
  correctly distinguish between CYP2D6*2 and *41 in the Black African individuals.
  Alleles not covered by the AmpliChip were identified and four novel CYP2D6 alleles
  were also detected. CYP2C19 PCR-RFLP identified CYP2C19*9,*15, *17 and *27 in the
  Black African individuals, with *2, *17 and *27 being relatively frequent in the
  cohort. Eliminating mismatches and identifying additional alleles will contribute
  to improving phenotype prediction for both enzymes. Phenotype prediction differed
  between platforms for both genes. Conclusion: Comprehensive genotyping of CYP2D6
  and CYP2C19 with the platforms used in this study, would be more appropriate than
  AmpliChip for phenotypic prediction in the South African population. Pharmacogenetically
  important novel alleles may remain undiscovered when using assays that are designed
  according to Caucasian specific variation, unless alternate strategies are utilised.'
