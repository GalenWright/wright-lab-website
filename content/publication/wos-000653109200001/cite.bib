 abstract = {Anthracyclines are highly effective chemotherapeutic agents; however,
their clinical utility is limited by severe anthracycline-induced
cardiotoxicity (ACT). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have
uncovered several genetic variants associated with ACT, but the impact
of these findings requires further elucidation. We conducted a
transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using our previous GWAS
summary statistics (n = 280 patients) to identify gene
expression-related associations with ACT. We identified a genetic
association between decreased expression of GDF5 and ACT (Z-score =
-4.30, P = 1.70 x 10(-5)), which was replicated in an independent cohort
(n = 845 patients, P = 3.54 x 10(-3)). Additionally, cell viability of
GDF5-silenced human cardiac myocytes was significantly decreased in
response to anthracycline treatment. Subsequent gene set enrichment and
pathway analyses of the TWAS data revealed that genes essential for
survival, cardioprotection and response to anthracyclines, as well as
genes involved in ribosomal, spliceosomal and cardiomyopathy pathways
are important for the development of ACT.},
