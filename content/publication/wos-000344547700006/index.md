abstract: Mutations in the GJB2 gene, encoding connexin 26, could account for 50%
  of congenital, nonsyndromic, recessive deafness cases in some Caucasian/Asian populations.
  There is a scarcity of published data in sub-Saharan Africans. We Sanger sequenced
  the coding region of the GJB2 gene in 205 Cameroonian and Xhosa South Africans with
  congenital, nonsyndromic deafness; and performed bioinformatic analysis of variations
  in the GJB2 gene, incorporating data from the 1000 Genomes Project. Amongst Cameroonian
  patients, 26.1% were familial. The majority of patients (70%) suffered from sensorineural
  hearing loss. Ten GJB2 genetic variants were detected by sequencing. A previously
  reported pathogenic mutation, g.3741_3743delTTC (p.F142del), and a putative pathogenic
  mutation, g.3816G>A (p.V167M), were identified in single heterozygous samples. Amongst
  eight the remaining variants, two novel variants, g.3318-41G>A and g.3332G>A, were
  reported. There were no statistically significant differences in allele frequencies
  between cases and controls. Principal Components Analyses differentiated between
  Africans, Asians, and Europeans, but only explained 40% of the variation. The present
  study is the first to compare African GJB2 sequences with the data from the 1000
  Genomes Project and have revealed the low variation between population groups. This
  finding has emphasized the hypothesis that the prevalence of mutations in GJB2 in
  nonsyndromic deafness amongst European and Asian populations is due to founder effects
  arising after these individuals migrated out of Africa, and not to a putative ``protectiveâ€³
  variant in the genomic structure of GJB2 in Africans. Our results confirm that mutations
  in GJB2 are not associated with nonsyndromic deafness in Africans.
