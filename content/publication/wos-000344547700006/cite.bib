 abstract = {Mutations in the GJB2 gene, encoding connexin 26, could account for 50%
of congenital, nonsyndromic, recessive deafness cases in some
Caucasian/Asian populations. There is a scarcity of published data in
sub-Saharan Africans. We Sanger sequenced the coding region of the GJB2
gene in 205 Cameroonian and Xhosa South Africans with congenital,
nonsyndromic deafness; and performed bioinformatic analysis of
variations in the GJB2 gene, incorporating data from the 1000 Genomes
Project. Amongst Cameroonian patients, 26.1% were familial. The
majority of patients (70%) suffered from sensorineural hearing loss.
Ten GJB2 genetic variants were detected by sequencing. A previously
reported pathogenic mutation, g.3741_3743delTTC (p.F142del), and a
putative pathogenic mutation, g.3816G>A (p.V167M), were identified in
single heterozygous samples. Amongst eight the remaining variants, two
novel variants, g.3318-41G>A and g.3332G>A, were reported. There were no
statistically significant differences in allele frequencies between
cases and controls. Principal Components Analyses differentiated between
Africans, Asians, and Europeans, but only explained 40% of the
variation. The present study is the first to compare African GJB2
sequences with the data from the 1000 Genomes Project and have revealed
the low variation between population groups. This finding has emphasized
the hypothesis that the prevalence of mutations in GJB2 in nonsyndromic
deafness amongst European and Asian populations is due to founder
effects arising after these individuals migrated out of Africa, and not
to a putative ``protectiveâ€³ variant in the genomic structure of GJB2
in Africans. Our results confirm that mutations in GJB2 are not
associated with nonsyndromic deafness in Africans.},
