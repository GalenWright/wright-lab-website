abstract: Background Huntington's disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that
  is caused by CAG-CAA repeat expansion, encoding polyglutamine, in the huntingtin
  (HTI) gene. Current age-of-clinical-onset prediction models for Huntington's disease
  are based on polyglutamine length and explain only a proportion of the variability
  in age of onset observed between patients. These length-based assays do not interrogate
  the underlying genetic variation, because known genetic variants in this region
  do not alter the protein coding sequence. Given that individuals with identical
  repeat lengths can present with Huntington's disease decades apart, the search for
  genetic modifiers of clinical age of onset has become an active area of research.
  Recent developments Results from three independent genetic studies of Huntington's
  disease have shown that glutamine-encoding CAA variants that interrupt DNA CAG repeat
  tracts, but do not alter polyglutamnine length or polyglutamine homogeneity, are
  associated with substantial differences in age of onset of Huntington's disease
  in carriers. A variant that results in the loss of CAA interruption is associated
  with early onset and is particularly relevant to individuals that carry alleles
  in the reduced penetrance range (ie, CAG 36-39). Approximately a third of clinically
  manifesting carriers of reduced penetrance alleles, defined by current diagnostics,
  carry this variant. Somatic repeat instability, modified by interrupted CAG tracts,
  is the most probable cause mediating this effect. This relationship is supported
  by genome-wide screens for disease modifiers, which have revealed the importance
  of DNA-repair genes in Huntington's disease (ie, FAN1, LIG1, MLH1, MSH3, PMS1, and
  PMS2). Where next? Focus needs to be placed on refining our understanding of the
  effect of the loss-of-interruption and duplication-of-interruption variants and
  other interrupting sequence variants on age of onset, and assessing their effect
  in disease-relevant brain tissues, as well as in diverse population groups, such
  as individuals from Africa and Asia. Diagnostic tests should be augmented or updated,
  since current tests do not assess the underlying DNA sequence variation, especially
  when assessing individuals that carry alleles in the reduced penetrance range. Future
  studies should explore somatic repeat instability and DNA repair as new therapeutic
  targets to modify age of onset in Huntington's disease and in other repeat-mediated
  disorders. Disease-modifying therapies could potentially be developed by therapeutically
  targeting these processes. Promising approaches include therapeutically targeting
  the expanded repeat or directly perturbing key DNA-repair genes (eg, with antisense
  oligonucleotides or small molecules). Targeting the CAG repeat directly with naphthyridine-azaquinolone,
  a compound that induces contractions, and altering the expression of MSH3, represent
  two viable therapeutic strategies. However, as a first step, the capability of such
  novel therapeutic approaches to delay clinical onset in animal models should be
  assessed.
