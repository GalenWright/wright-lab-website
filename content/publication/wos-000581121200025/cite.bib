 abstract = {Background Huntington's disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder
that is caused by CAG-CAA repeat expansion, encoding polyglutamine, in
the huntingtin (HTI) gene. Current age-of-clinical-onset prediction
models for Huntington's disease are based on polyglutamine length and
explain only a proportion of the variability in age of onset observed
between patients. These length-based assays do not interrogate the
underlying genetic variation, because known genetic variants in this
region do not alter the protein coding sequence. Given that individuals
with identical repeat lengths can present with Huntington's disease
decades apart, the search for genetic modifiers of clinical age of onset
has become an active area of research.
Recent developments Results from three independent genetic studies of
Huntington's disease have shown that glutamine-encoding CAA variants
that interrupt DNA CAG repeat tracts, but do not alter polyglutamnine
length or polyglutamine homogeneity, are associated with substantial
differences in age of onset of Huntington's disease in carriers. A
variant that results in the loss of CAA interruption is associated with
early onset and is particularly relevant to individuals that carry
alleles in the reduced penetrance range (ie, CAG 36-39). Approximately a
third of clinically manifesting carriers of reduced penetrance alleles,
defined by current diagnostics, carry this variant. Somatic repeat
instability, modified by interrupted CAG tracts, is the most probable
cause mediating this effect. This relationship is supported by
genome-wide screens for disease modifiers, which have revealed the
importance of DNA-repair genes in Huntington's disease (ie, FAN1, LIG1,
MLH1, MSH3, PMS1, and PMS2).
Where next? Focus needs to be placed on refining our understanding of
the effect of the loss-of-interruption and duplication-of-interruption
variants and other interrupting sequence variants on age of onset, and
assessing their effect in disease-relevant brain tissues, as well as in
diverse population groups, such as individuals from Africa and Asia.
Diagnostic tests should be augmented or updated, since current tests do
not assess the underlying DNA sequence variation, especially when
assessing individuals that carry alleles in the reduced penetrance
range. Future studies should explore somatic repeat instability and DNA
repair as new therapeutic targets to modify age of onset in Huntington's
disease and in other repeat-mediated disorders. Disease-modifying
therapies could potentially be developed by therapeutically targeting
these processes. Promising approaches include therapeutically targeting
the expanded repeat or directly perturbing key DNA-repair genes (eg,
with antisense oligonucleotides or small molecules). Targeting the CAG
repeat directly with naphthyridine-azaquinolone, a compound that induces
contractions, and altering the expression of MSH3, represent two viable
therapeutic strategies. However, as a first step, the capability of such
novel therapeutic approaches to delay clinical onset in animal models
should be assessed.},
