abstract: 'Although previous research identified candidate genetic polymorphisms associated
  with cisplatin nephrotoxicity, varying outcome definitions potentially contributed
  to the variability in the effect size and direction of this relationship. We selected
  genetic variants that have been significantly associated with cisplatin-induced
  nephrotoxicity in more than one published study (SLC22A2 rs316019; ERCC1 rs11615
  and rs3212986; ERCC2 rs1799793 and rs13181) and performed a replication analysis
  to confirm associations between these genetic polymorphisms and cisplatin nephrotoxicity
  using various outcome definitions. We included 282 germ cell testicular cancer patients
  treated with cisplatin from 2009-2014, aged >17 years recruited by the Canadian
  Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug Safety. Nephrotoxicity was defined using four
  grading tools: (1) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03
  for acute kidney injury (AKI) or CTCAE-AKI; (2) adjusted cisplatin-induced AKI;
  (3) elevation of serum creatinine; and (4) reduction in the estimated glomerular
  filtration rate (eGFR). Significant associations were only found when using the
  CTCAE v4.03 definition: genotype CA of the ERCC1 rs3212986 was associated with decreased
  risk of cisplatin nephrotoxicity (ORadj = 0.24; 95% CI: 0.08-0.70; p = 0.009) compared
  to genotype CC. In contrast, addition of allele A at SLC22A2 rs316019 was associated
  with increased risk (ORadj = 4.41; 95% CI: 1.96-9.88; p < 0.001) while genotype
  AC was associated with a higher risk of cisplatin nephrotoxicity (ORadj = 5.06;
  95% CI: 1.69-15.16; p = 0.004) compared to genotype CC. Our study showed that different
  case definitions led to variability in the genetic risk ascertainment of cisplatin
  nephrotoxicity. Therefore, consensus on a set of clinically relevant outcome definitions
  that all such studies should follow is needed.'
