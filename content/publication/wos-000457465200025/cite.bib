 abstract = {Vincristine is an effective chemotherapeutic drug for various cancers,
including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Unfortunately, clinical
utility is restricted by dose-limiting vincristine-induced peripheral
neuropathies (VIPN). We sought to determine the association of VIPN with
a recently identified risk variant, CEP72 rs924607, and drug absorption,
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) gene variants in
pediatric ALL. This was followed by a meta-analysis of pharmacogenomic
data from over 500 patients. CEP72 rs924607 was significantly associated
with VIPN (P = 0.02; odds ratio (OR) = 3.4). ADME analyses identified
associations between VIPN and ABCC1 rs3784867 (P = 5.34 x 10(-5); OR =
4.9), and SLC5A7 rs1013940 (P = 9.00 x 10(-4); OR= 8.6); genes involved
in vincristine transport and inherited neuropathies, respectively.
Meta-analysis identified an association with a variant related to TTPA
(rs10504361: P = 6.85 x 10(-4); OR = 2.0), a heritable
neuropathy-related gene. This study provides essential corroboratory
evidence for CEP72 rs924607 and highlights the importance of drug
transporter and inherited neuropathy genes in VIPN.},
