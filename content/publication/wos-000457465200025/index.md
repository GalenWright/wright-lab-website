abstract: 'Vincristine is an effective chemotherapeutic drug for various cancers,
  including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Unfortunately, clinical utility is
  restricted by dose-limiting vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathies (VIPN).
  We sought to determine the association of VIPN with a recently identified risk variant,
  CEP72 rs924607, and drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)
  gene variants in pediatric ALL. This was followed by a meta-analysis of pharmacogenomic
  data from over 500 patients. CEP72 rs924607 was significantly associated with VIPN
  (P = 0.02; odds ratio (OR) = 3.4). ADME analyses identified associations between
  VIPN and ABCC1 rs3784867 (P = 5.34 x 10(-5); OR = 4.9), and SLC5A7 rs1013940 (P
  = 9.00 x 10(-4); OR= 8.6); genes involved in vincristine transport and inherited
  neuropathies, respectively. Meta-analysis identified an association with a variant
  related to TTPA (rs10504361: P = 6.85 x 10(-4); OR = 2.0), a heritable neuropathy-related
  gene. This study provides essential corroboratory evidence for CEP72 rs924607 and
  highlights the importance of drug transporter and inherited neuropathy genes in
  VIPN.'
