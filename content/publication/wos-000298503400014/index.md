abstract: Africa suffers from a high burden of disease; nonetheless, it has been one
  of the most under-represented continents with regard to genomic research. It can
  be argued that this disproportionate research is related to the fact that the genome
  architecture of African individuals is poorly suited to SNP-based genome-wide association
  studies, given existing genotyping platforms. However, this argument is no longer
  plausible with the arrival of next-generation sequencing technologies, which allow
  for the ana-lysis of entire genomes. Using pharmacogenes to critically examine the
  merit of next-generation sequencing technologies in pharmacogenomics, we found a
  substantial amount of novel/uncharacterized variation, which was predicted to alter
  protein function. This variation was predominantly observed in African individuals,
  emphasizing the benefit of next-generation sequencing technologies specifically
  for these individuals. We also observed an improvement in the reliability of sequencing
  technologies in a relatively short time. Therefore, as sequencing technologies develop
  and decrease in cost, the ability to reliably detect variation will improve and
  these technologies will begin to replace other less comprehensive genotyping assays.
