 abstract = {Africa suffers from a high burden of disease; nonetheless, it has been
one of the most under-represented continents with regard to genomic
research. It can be argued that this disproportionate research is
related to the fact that the genome architecture of African individuals
is poorly suited to SNP-based genome-wide association studies, given
existing genotyping platforms. However, this argument is no longer
plausible with the arrival of next-generation sequencing technologies,
which allow for the ana-lysis of entire genomes. Using pharmacogenes to
critically examine the merit of next-generation sequencing technologies
in pharmacogenomics, we found a substantial amount of
novel/uncharacterized variation, which was predicted to alter protein
function. This variation was predominantly observed in African
individuals, emphasizing the benefit of next-generation sequencing
technologies specifically for these individuals. We also observed an
improvement in the reliability of sequencing technologies in a
relatively short time. Therefore, as sequencing technologies develop and
decrease in cost, the ability to reliably detect variation will improve
and these technologies will begin to replace other less comprehensive
genotyping assays.},
