abstract: 'Purpose: Adverse drug reactions such as ototoxicity, which occurs in approximately
  one-fifth of adult patients who receive cisplatin treatment, can incur large socioeconomic
  burdens on patients with testicular cancer who develop this cancer during early
  adulthood. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants
  in ACYP2 and WFS1 that are associated with cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. We sought
  to explore the role of these genetic susceptibility factors to cisplatin-induced
  ototoxicity in patients with testicular cancer. Experimental Design: Extensive clinical
  and demographic data were collected for 229 patients with testicular cancer treated
  with cisplatin. Patients were genotyped for two variants, ACYP2 rs1872328 and WFS1
  rs62283056, that have previously been associated with hearing loss in cisplatin-treated
  patients. Analyses were performed to investigate the association of these variants
  with ototoxicity in this cohort of adult patients with testicular cancer. Results:
  Pharmacogenomic analyses revealed that ACYP2 rs1872328 was significantly associated
  with cisplatin-induced ototoxicity [P = 2.83 x 10(-3), OR (95% CI): 14.7 (2.6-84.2)].
  WFS1 rs62283056 was not significantly associated with ototoxicity caused by cisplatin
  (P = 0.39); however, this variant was associated with hearing loss attributable
  to any cause [P = 5.67 x 10(-3), OR (95% CI): 3.2 (1.4-7.7)]. Conclusions: This
  study has provided the first evidence for the role of ACYP2 rs1872328 in cisplatin-induced
  ototoxicity in patients with testicular cancer. These results support the use of
  this information to guide the development of strategies to prevent cisplatin-induced
  ototoxicity across cancers. Further, this study has highlighted the importance of
  phenotypic differences in replication studies and has provided further evidence
  for the role of WFS1 rs62283056 in susceptibility to hearing loss, which may be
  worsened by cisplatin treatment. (C) 2018 AACR.'
