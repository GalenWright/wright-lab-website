 abstract = {Purpose: Adverse drug reactions such as ototoxicity, which occurs in
approximately one-fifth of adult patients who receive cisplatin
treatment, can incur large socioeconomic burdens on patients with
testicular cancer who develop this cancer during early adulthood. Recent
genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants in
ACYP2 and WFS1 that are associated with cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.
We sought to explore the role of these genetic susceptibility factors to
cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in patients with testicular cancer.
Experimental Design: Extensive clinical and demographic data were
collected for 229 patients with testicular cancer treated with
cisplatin. Patients were genotyped for two variants, ACYP2 rs1872328 and
WFS1 rs62283056, that have previously been associated with hearing loss
in cisplatin-treated patients. Analyses were performed to investigate
the association of these variants with ototoxicity in this cohort of
adult patients with testicular cancer.
Results: Pharmacogenomic analyses revealed that ACYP2 rs1872328 was
significantly associated with cisplatin-induced ototoxicity [P = 2.83
x 10(-3), OR (95% CI): 14.7 (2.6-84.2)]. WFS1 rs62283056 was not
significantly associated with ototoxicity caused by cisplatin (P =
0.39); however, this variant was associated with hearing loss
attributable to any cause [P = 5.67 x 10(-3), OR (95% CI): 3.2
(1.4-7.7)].
Conclusions: This study has provided the first evidence for the role of
ACYP2 rs1872328 in cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in patients with
testicular cancer. These results support the use of this information to
guide the development of strategies to prevent cisplatin-induced
ototoxicity across cancers. Further, this study has highlighted the
importance of phenotypic differences in replication studies and has
provided further evidence for the role of WFS1 rs62283056 in
susceptibility to hearing loss, which may be worsened by cisplatin
treatment. (C) 2018 AACR.},
