 abstract = {Introduction: Investigating variation in genes involved in the
absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of drugs are
key to characterizing pharmacogenomic (PGx) relationships. ADME gene
variation is relatively well characterized in European and Asian
populations, but data from African populations are under-studied-which
has implications for drug safety and effective use in Africa.Results: We
identified significant ADME gene variation in African populations using
data from 458 high-coverage whole genome sequences, 412 of which are
novel, and from previously available African sequences from the 1,000
Genomes Project. ADME variation was not uniform across African
populations, particularly within high impact coding variation. Copy
number variation was detected in 116 ADME genes, with equal ratios of
duplications/deletions. We identified 930 potential high impact coding
variants, of which most are discrete to a single African population
cluster. Large frequency differences (i.e., >10%) were seen in common
high impact variants between clusters. Several novel variants are
predicted to have a significant impact on protein structure, but
additional functional work is needed to confirm the outcome of these for
PGx use. Most variants of known clinical outcome are rare in Africa
compared to European populations, potentially reflecting a clinical PGx
research bias to European populations.Discussion: The genetic diversity
of ADME genes across sub-Saharan African populations is large. The
Southern African population cluster is most distinct from that of far
West Africa. PGx strategies based on European variants will be of
limited use in African populations. Although established variants are
important, PGx must take into account the full range of African
variation. This work urges further characterization of variants in
African populations including in vitro and in silico studies, and to
consider the unique African ADME landscape when developing precision
medicine guidelines and tools for African populations.},
