 abstract = {Differences in response to medications have a strong genetic component.
By leveraging publically available data, the spectrum of such genomic
variation can be investigated extensively. Pharmacogenomic variation was
extracted from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 data (2504 individuals,
26 global populations). A total of 12 084 genetic variants were found in
120 pharmacogenes, with the majority (90.0%) classified as rare
variants (global minor allele frequency <0.5%), with 52.9% being
singletons. Common variation clustered individuals into continental
super-populations and 23 pharmacogenes contained highly differentiated
variants (F-ST>0.5) for one or more super-population comparison. A
median of three clinical variants (PharmGKB level 1A/B) was found per
individual, and 55.4% of individuals carried loss-of-function variants,
varying by super-population (East Asian 60.9% >African 60.1% >South
Asian 60.3% >European 49.3% >Admixed 39.2%). Genome sequencing can
therefore identify clinical pharmacogenomic variation, and future
studies need to consider rare variation to understand the spectrum of
genetic diversity contributing to drug response.},
