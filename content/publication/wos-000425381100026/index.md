abstract: Differences in response to medications have a strong genetic component.
  By leveraging publically available data, the spectrum of such genomic variation
  can be investigated extensively. Pharmacogenomic variation was extracted from the
  1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 data (2504 individuals, 26 global populations). A total
  of 12 084 genetic variants were found in 120 pharmacogenes, with the majority (90.0%)
  classified as rare variants (global minor allele frequency <0.5%), with 52.9% being
  singletons. Common variation clustered individuals into continental super-populations
  and 23 pharmacogenes contained highly differentiated variants (F-ST>0.5) for one
  or more super-population comparison. A median of three clinical variants (PharmGKB
  level 1A/B) was found per individual, and 55.4% of individuals carried loss-of-function
  variants, varying by super-population (East Asian 60.9% >African 60.1% >South Asian
  60.3% >European 49.3% >Admixed 39.2%). Genome sequencing can therefore identify
  clinical pharmacogenomic variation, and future studies need to consider rare variation
  to understand the spectrum of genetic diversity contributing to drug response.
