abstract: 'Huntington disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin
  (HTT) gene. Although the length of this repeat is inversely correlated with age
  of onset (AOO), it does not fully explain the variability in AOO. We assessed the
  sequence downstream of the CAG repeat in HTT [reference: (CAG)n-CAA-CAG], since
  variants within this region have been previously described, but no study of AOO
  has been performed. These analyses identified a variant that results in complete
  loss of interrupting (LOI) adenine nucleotides in this region [(CAG)n-CAG-CAG].
  Analysis of multiple HD pedigrees showed that this LOI variant is associated with
  dramatically earlier AOO (average of 25 years) despite the same polyglutamine length
  as in individuals with the interrupting penultimate CAA codon. This LOI allele is
  particularly frequent in persons with reduced penetrance alleles who manifest with
  HD and increases the likelihood of presenting clinically with HD with a CAG of 36-39
  repeats. Further, we show that the LOI variant is associated with increased somatic
  repeat instability, highlighting this as a significant driver of this effect. These
  findings indicate that the number of uninterrupted CAG repeats, which is lengthened
  by the LOI, is the most significant contributor to AOO of HD and is more significant
  than polyglutamine length, which is not altered in these individuals. In addition,
  we identified another variant in this region, where the CAA-CAG sequence is duplicated,
  which was associated with later AOO. Identification of these cis-acting modifiers
  have potentially important implications for genetic counselling in HD-affected families.'
