 abstract = {Huntington disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the
huntingtin (HTT) gene. Although the length of this repeat is inversely
correlated with age of onset (AOO), it does not fully explain the
variability in AOO. We assessed the sequence downstream of the CAG
repeat in HTT [reference: (CAG)n-CAA-CAG], since variants within this
region have been previously described, but no study of AOO has been
performed. These analyses identified a variant that results in complete
loss of interrupting (LOI) adenine nucleotides in this region
[(CAG)n-CAG-CAG]. Analysis of multiple HD pedigrees showed that this
LOI variant is associated with dramatically earlier AOO (average of 25
years) despite the same polyglutamine length as in individuals with the
interrupting penultimate CAA codon. This LOI allele is particularly
frequent in persons with reduced penetrance alleles who manifest with HD
and increases the likelihood of presenting clinically with HD with a CAG
of 36-39 repeats. Further, we show that the LOI variant is associated
with increased somatic repeat instability, highlighting this as a
significant driver of this effect. These findings indicate that the
number of uninterrupted CAG repeats, which is lengthened by the LOI, is
the most significant contributor to AOO of HD and is more significant
than polyglutamine length, which is not altered in these individuals. In
addition, we identified another variant in this region, where the
CAA-CAG sequence is duplicated, which was associated with later AOO.
Identification of these cis-acting modifiers have potentially important
implications for genetic counselling in HD-affected families.},
