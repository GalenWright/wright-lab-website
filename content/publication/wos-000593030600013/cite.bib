 abstract = {Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is caused
by a CAG repeat expansion in HTT. The length of this repeat, however,
only explains a proportion of the variability in age of onset in
patients. Genome-wide association studies have identified modifiers that
contribute toward a proportion of the observed variance. By
incorporating tissue-specific transcriptomic information with these
results, additional modifiers can be identified. We performed a
transcriptome-wide association study assessing heritable differences in
genetically determined expression in diverse tissues, with genome-wide
data from over 4000 patients. Functional validation of prioritized genes
was undertaken in isogenic HD stem cells and patient brains. Enrichment
analyses were performed with biologically relevant gene sets to identify
the core pathways. HD-associated gene coexpression modules were assessed
for associations with neurological phenotypes in an independent cohort
and to guide drug repurposing analyses. Transcriptomic analyses
identified genes that were associated with age of HD onset and displayed
colocalization with gene expression signals in brain tissue (FAN1,
GPR161, PMS2, SUMF2), with supporting evidence from functional
experiments. This included genes involved in DNA repair, as well as
novel-candidate modifier genes that have been associated with other
neurological conditions. Further, cortical coexpression modules were
also associated with cognitive decline and HD-related traits in a
longitudinal cohort. In summary, the combination of population-scale
gene expression information with HD patient genomic data identified
novel modifier genes for the disorder. Further, these analyses expanded
the pathways potentially involved in modifying HD onset and prioritized
candidate therapeutics for future study.

transcriptomic modifiers of Huntington disease (HD). Transcriptome-wide
association analyses facilitated (A) the identification of top
transcriptomic HD onset modifier genes, (B) relevant biologically
diverse gene sets that are enriched for this trait and (C) human
cortical coexpression modules that are relevant for HD onset and related
phenotypes in an aging cohort, along with signature matching of HD
signals for drug repurposing.},
