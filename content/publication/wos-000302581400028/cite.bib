 abstract = {Chromosome 22q11 aberrations substantially increase the risk for
developing schizophrenia. Although micro-deletions in this region have
been extensively investigated in different populations across the world,
little is known of their prevalence in African subjects with
schizophrenia. We screened 110 African Xhosa-speaking participants with
schizophrenia for the presence of micro-deletions. As further
verification for the presence or absence of 22q11 micro-deletions, we
screened 238 Xhosa schizophrenia patients and 240 healthy Xhosa
individuals from a larger schizophrenia candidate 22q11 gene study using
molecular analyses. Data from molecular and cytogenetic analyses
confirmed the absence of 22q11 micro-deletions in the Xhosa
schizophrenia samples. Although the absence of chromosome 22q11
micro-deletions in this group of patients does not exclude the
possibility that it may occur in Xhosa schizophrenia patients, we
concluded an extremely low prevalence. Our findings suggest that unique
susceptibility loci may be present in this group.},
