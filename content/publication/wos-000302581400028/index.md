abstract: Chromosome 22q11 aberrations substantially increase the risk for developing
  schizophrenia. Although micro-deletions in this region have been extensively investigated
  in different populations across the world, little is known of their prevalence in
  African subjects with schizophrenia. We screened 110 African Xhosa-speaking participants
  with schizophrenia for the presence of micro-deletions. As further verification
  for the presence or absence of 22q11 micro-deletions, we screened 238 Xhosa schizophrenia
  patients and 240 healthy Xhosa individuals from a larger schizophrenia candidate
  22q11 gene study using molecular analyses. Data from molecular and cytogenetic analyses
  confirmed the absence of 22q11 micro-deletions in the Xhosa schizophrenia samples.
  Although the absence of chromosome 22q11 micro-deletions in this group of patients
  does not exclude the possibility that it may occur in Xhosa schizophrenia patients,
  we concluded an extremely low prevalence. Our findings suggest that unique susceptibility
  loci may be present in this group.
