 abstract = {PurposeTamoxifen is one of the principal treatments for estrogen
receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Unfortunately, between 30 and 50%
of patients receiving this hormonal therapy relapse. Since CYP2D6
genetic variants have been reported to play an important role in
survival outcomes after treatment with tamoxifen, this study sought to
summarize and critically appraise the available scientific evidence on
this topic.MethodsA systematic literature review was conducted to
identify studies investigating associations between CYP2D6 genetic
variation and survival outcomes after tamoxifen treatment. Critical
appraisal of the retrieved scientific evidence was performed, and
recommendations were developed for CYP2D6 genetic testing in the context
of tamoxifen therapy.ResultsAlthough conflicting literature exists, the
majority of the current evidence points toward CYP2D6 genetic variation
affecting survival outcomes after tamoxifen treatment. Of note, review
of the CYP2D6 genotyping assays used in each of the studies revealed the
importance of comprehensive genotyping strategies to accurately predict
CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotypes.Conclusions and recommendationsCritical
appraisal of the literature provided evidence for the value of
comprehensive CYP2D6 genotyping panels in guiding treatment decisions
for non-metastatic ER-positive breast cancer patients. Based on this
information, it is recommended that alternatives to standard tamoxifen
treatments may be considered in CYP2D6 poor or intermediate
metabolizers.},
