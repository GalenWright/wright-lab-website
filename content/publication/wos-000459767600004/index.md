abstract: PurposeTamoxifen is one of the principal treatments for estrogen receptor
  (ER)-positive breast cancer. Unfortunately, between 30 and 50% of patients receiving
  this hormonal therapy relapse. Since CYP2D6 genetic variants have been reported
  to play an important role in survival outcomes after treatment with tamoxifen, this
  study sought to summarize and critically appraise the available scientific evidence
  on this topic.MethodsA systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies
  investigating associations between CYP2D6 genetic variation and survival outcomes
  after tamoxifen treatment. Critical appraisal of the retrieved scientific evidence
  was performed, and recommendations were developed for CYP2D6 genetic testing in
  the context of tamoxifen therapy.ResultsAlthough conflicting literature exists,
  the majority of the current evidence points toward CYP2D6 genetic variation affecting
  survival outcomes after tamoxifen treatment. Of note, review of the CYP2D6 genotyping
  assays used in each of the studies revealed the importance of comprehensive genotyping
  strategies to accurately predict CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotypes.Conclusions and recommendationsCritical
  appraisal of the literature provided evidence for the value of comprehensive CYP2D6
  genotyping panels in guiding treatment decisions for non-metastatic ER-positive
  breast cancer patients. Based on this information, it is recommended that alternatives
  to standard tamoxifen treatments may be considered in CYP2D6 poor or intermediate
  metabolizers.
