abstract: Psychiatric disorders place a considerable healthcare burden on South African
  society Incorporating genetic technologies into future treatment plans offers a
  potential mechanism to reduce this burden, This review focuses on psychiatric genetic
  research that has been performed in South African populations with regards to obsessive-compulsive
  disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Preliminary findings from these studies
  suggest that data obtained in developed countries cannot necessarily be extrapolated
  to South African population groups. Psychiatric genetic studies in South Africa
  seem to involve relatively low-cost methodologies and only a limited number of large
  national collaborative studies. Future research in South Africa should therefore
  aim to incorporate high-throughput technologies into large scale psychiatric studies
  through the development of collaborations. On a global level, the vast majority
  of psychiatric genetic studies have been performed in non-African populations. South
  Africa, as the leading contributor to scientific research in Africa, may provide
  a foundation for addressing this disparity and strengthening psychiatric genetic
  research on the continent. Although the elucidation of the genetic architecture
  of psychiatric disorders has proved challenging, examining the unique genetic profiles
  found in South African populations could provide valuable insight into the genetics
  of psychiatric disorders.
