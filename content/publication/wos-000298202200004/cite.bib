 abstract = {Psychiatric disorders place a considerable healthcare burden on South
African society Incorporating genetic technologies into future treatment
plans offers a potential mechanism to reduce this burden, This review
focuses on psychiatric genetic research that has been performed in South
African populations with regards to obsessive-compulsive disorder,
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Preliminary findings from these
studies suggest that data obtained in developed countries cannot
necessarily be extrapolated to South African population groups.
Psychiatric genetic studies in South Africa seem to involve relatively
low-cost methodologies and only a limited number of large national
collaborative studies. Future research in South Africa should therefore
aim to incorporate high-throughput technologies into large scale
psychiatric studies through the development of collaborations. On a
global level, the vast majority of psychiatric genetic studies have been
performed in non-African populations. South Africa, as the leading
contributor to scientific research in Africa, may provide a foundation
for addressing this disparity and strengthening psychiatric genetic
research on the continent. Although the elucidation of the genetic
architecture of psychiatric disorders has proved challenging, examining
the unique genetic profiles found in South African populations could
provide valuable insight into the genetics of psychiatric disorders.},
