 abstract = {P>Genetic variation of the CYP2D6 gene has been associated with altered
drug metabolism; however, limited studies have investigated CYP2D6
sequence diversity in African populations. We devised a CYP2D6
genotyping strategy to analyse the South African Xhosa population and
genotype a Xhosa schizophrenia cohort, as CYP2D6 metabolises many
antipsychotics and antidepressants.
The entire CYP2D6 gene locus was sequenced in 15 Xhosa control
individuals and the data generated were used to design a comprehensive
genotyping strategy. Over 25 CYP2D6 alleles were genotyped in Xhosa
controls and Xhosa schizophrenia patients using long-range PCR, DNA
sequencing and single nucleotide primer extension analysis.
Bioinformatic algorithms were used to predict the functional
consequences of relevant mutations and samples were assigned CYP2D6
activity scores.
A unique allele distribution was revealed and two rare novel alleles,
CYP2D6*73 and CYP2D6*74, were identified. No significant differences
in allele frequencies were detected between Xhosa controls and
schizophrenia patients. This study provides i) comprehensive data on a
poorly characterised population, ii) a valuable CYP2D6 genotyping
strategy and iii) due to their unique genetic profile, provides the
basis for pharmacogenetic intervention for Xhosa individuals.},
