abstract: P>Genetic variation of the CYP2D6 gene has been associated with altered
  drug metabolism; however, limited studies have investigated CYP2D6 sequence diversity
  in African populations. We devised a CYP2D6 genotyping strategy to analyse the South
  African Xhosa population and genotype a Xhosa schizophrenia cohort, as CYP2D6 metabolises
  many antipsychotics and antidepressants. The entire CYP2D6 gene locus was sequenced
  in 15 Xhosa control individuals and the data generated were used to design a comprehensive
  genotyping strategy. Over 25 CYP2D6 alleles were genotyped in Xhosa controls and
  Xhosa schizophrenia patients using long-range PCR, DNA sequencing and single nucleotide
  primer extension analysis. Bioinformatic algorithms were used to predict the functional
  consequences of relevant mutations and samples were assigned CYP2D6 activity scores.
  A unique allele distribution was revealed and two rare novel alleles, CYP2D6*73
  and CYP2D6*74, were identified. No significant differences in allele frequencies
  were detected between Xhosa controls and schizophrenia patients. This study provides
  i) comprehensive data on a poorly characterised population, ii) a valuable CYP2D6
  genotyping strategy and iii) due to their unique genetic profile, provides the basis
  for pharmacogenetic intervention for Xhosa individuals.
