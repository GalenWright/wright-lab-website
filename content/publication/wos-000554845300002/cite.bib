 abstract = {Purpose In some Huntington disease (HD) patients, the ``loss of
interruptionâ€³ (LOI) variant eliminates an interrupting codon in
theHTTCAG-repeat tract, which causes earlier age of onset (AOO). The
magnitude of this effect is uncertain, since previous studies included
few LOI carriers, and the variant also causes CAG size misestimation. We
developed a rapid LOI detection screen, enabling unbiased frequency
estimation among manifest HD patients. Additionally, we combined
published data with clinical data from newly identified patients to
accurately characterize the LOI's effect on AOO. Methods We developed a
LOI detection polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, and screened
patients to estimate the frequency of the LOI variant and its effect on
AOO. Results Mean onset for LOI carriers (n = 49) is 20.4 years earlier
than expected based on diagnosed CAG size. After correcting for CAG size
underestimation, the variant is still associated with onset 9.5 years
earlier. The LOI is present in 1.02% of symptomatic HD patients, and in
32.2% of symptomatic reduced penetrance (RP) range patients (36-39
CAGs). Conclusion The LOI causes significantly earlier onset, greater
than expected by CAG length, particularly in persons with 36-39 CAG
repeats. Detection of this variant has implications for HD families,
especially for those in the RP range.},
