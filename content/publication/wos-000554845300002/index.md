abstract: Purpose In some Huntington disease (HD) patients, the ``loss of interruptionâ€³
  (LOI) variant eliminates an interrupting codon in theHTTCAG-repeat tract, which
  causes earlier age of onset (AOO). The magnitude of this effect is uncertain, since
  previous studies included few LOI carriers, and the variant also causes CAG size
  misestimation. We developed a rapid LOI detection screen, enabling unbiased frequency
  estimation among manifest HD patients. Additionally, we combined published data
  with clinical data from newly identified patients to accurately characterize the
  LOI's effect on AOO. Methods We developed a LOI detection polymerase chain reaction
  (PCR) assay, and screened patients to estimate the frequency of the LOI variant
  and its effect on AOO. Results Mean onset for LOI carriers (n = 49) is 20.4 years
  earlier than expected based on diagnosed CAG size. After correcting for CAG size
  underestimation, the variant is still associated with onset 9.5 years earlier. The
  LOI is present in 1.02% of symptomatic HD patients, and in 32.2% of symptomatic
  reduced penetrance (RP) range patients (36-39 CAGs). Conclusion The LOI causes significantly
  earlier onset, greater than expected by CAG length, particularly in persons with
  36-39 CAG repeats. Detection of this variant has implications for HD families, especially
  for those in the RP range.
