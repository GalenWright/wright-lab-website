 abstract = {Aims: This study was aimed at elucidating the common sequence variation
present in the CYP2C19 gene within the South African Xhosa population
and comparing it with the Cape Mixed Ancestry (CMA) population for
possible future pharmacogenetic applications. Materials & methods:
Common sequence variation was identified through the resequencing of 15
Xhosa individuals. The detected variants were prioritized for genotyping
in an additional 85 Xhosa and 75 CMA individuals, while 5â€³-upstream
variants were analyzed using dual luciferase reporter assays. Results:
Resequencing of the Xhosa population revealed 30 variants, including the
novel CYP2C19*27 and CYP2C19*28 alleles. CYP2C19*27, characterized
by -1041G>A, caused a twofold decrease in luciferase activity, while
CYP2C19*28 is characterized by the nonsynonymous V374I variant. In
addition, the previously characterized variants, CYP2C19*2,
CYP2C19*9 and CYP2C19*17, were present in both populations, while
CYP2C19*3 was only observed in the CMA population. Conclusion: Our
data demonstrate that both the Xhosa and CMA populations exhibit unique
genetic profiles that could influence the outcome of drug therapy in
these populations.},
