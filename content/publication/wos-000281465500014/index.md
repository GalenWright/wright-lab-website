abstract: 'Aims: This study was aimed at elucidating the common sequence variation
  present in the CYP2C19 gene within the South African Xhosa population and comparing
  it with the Cape Mixed Ancestry (CMA) population for possible future pharmacogenetic
  applications. Materials & methods: Common sequence variation was identified through
  the resequencing of 15 Xhosa individuals. The detected variants were prioritized
  for genotyping in an additional 85 Xhosa and 75 CMA individuals, while 5â€³-upstream
  variants were analyzed using dual luciferase reporter assays. Results: Resequencing
  of the Xhosa population revealed 30 variants, including the novel CYP2C19*27 and
  CYP2C19*28 alleles. CYP2C19*27, characterized by -1041G>A, caused a twofold decrease
  in luciferase activity, while CYP2C19*28 is characterized by the nonsynonymous V374I
  variant. In addition, the previously characterized variants, CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*9
  and CYP2C19*17, were present in both populations, while CYP2C19*3 was only observed
  in the CMA population. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that both the Xhosa and
  CMA populations exhibit unique genetic profiles that could influence the outcome
  of drug therapy in these populations.'
