 abstract = {Huntington disease (HD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused
by a CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. HD occurs
worldwide, but the causative mutation is found on different HTT
haplotypes in distinct ethnic groups. In Latin America, HD is thought to
have European origins, but indigenous Amerindian ancestry has not been
investigated. Here, we report dense HTT haplotypes in 62 mestizo
Peruvian HD families, 17 HD families from across Latin America, and 42
controls of defined Peruvian Amerindian ethnicity to determine the
origin of HD in populations of admixed Amerindian and European descent.
HD in Peru occurs most frequently on the A1 HTT haplotype (73%), as in
Europe, but on an unexpected indigenous variant also found in Amerindian
controls. This Amerindian A1 HTT haplotype predominates over the
European A1 variant among geographically disparate Latin American
controls and in HD families from across Latin America, supporting an
indigenous origin of the HD mutation in mestizo American populations. We
also show that a proportion of HD mutations in Peru occur on a C1 HTT
haplotype of putative Amerindian origin (14%). The majority of HD
mutations in Latin America may therefore occur on haplotypes of
Amerindian ancestry rather than on haplotypes resulting from European
admixture. Despite the distinct ethnic ancestry of Amerindian and
European A1 HTT, alleles on the parent A1 HTT haplotype allow for
development of identical antisense molecules to selectively silence the
HD mutation in the greatest proportion of patients in both Latin
American and European populations.},
