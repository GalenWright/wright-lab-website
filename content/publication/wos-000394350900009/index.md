abstract: Huntington disease (HD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused
  by a CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. HD occurs worldwide, but
  the causative mutation is found on different HTT haplotypes in distinct ethnic groups.
  In Latin America, HD is thought to have European origins, but indigenous Amerindian
  ancestry has not been investigated. Here, we report dense HTT haplotypes in 62 mestizo
  Peruvian HD families, 17 HD families from across Latin America, and 42 controls
  of defined Peruvian Amerindian ethnicity to determine the origin of HD in populations
  of admixed Amerindian and European descent. HD in Peru occurs most frequently on
  the A1 HTT haplotype (73%), as in Europe, but on an unexpected indigenous variant
  also found in Amerindian controls. This Amerindian A1 HTT haplotype predominates
  over the European A1 variant among geographically disparate Latin American controls
  and in HD families from across Latin America, supporting an indigenous origin of
  the HD mutation in mestizo American populations. We also show that a proportion
  of HD mutations in Peru occur on a C1 HTT haplotype of putative Amerindian origin
  (14%). The majority of HD mutations in Latin America may therefore occur on haplotypes
  of Amerindian ancestry rather than on haplotypes resulting from European admixture.
  Despite the distinct ethnic ancestry of Amerindian and European A1 HTT, alleles
  on the parent A1 HTT haplotype allow for development of identical antisense molecules
  to selectively silence the HD mutation in the greatest proportion of patients in
  both Latin American and European populations.
