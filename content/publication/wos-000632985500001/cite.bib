Disease-focused genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a
plethora of actionable genetic variants over the last 20 years.
International collaboration and technological breakthroughs have enabled
rapid genotyping and data collection, which has correspondingly
increased sample size and power. Contrastingly, recruitment of
well-characterized cohorts of patients for pharmacogenomics research has
proven challenging. Given the greater number of associated genetic
variants and larger cohort sizes in common disease GWAS, we hypothesized
that integrating genome-wide disease and pharmacogenomic data may drive
new insights into drug toxicity and drug efficacy phenotypes, beyond the
standard scope of current pharmacogenetic analyses. Using GWAS summary
statistics from the UK Biobank, European Bioinformatics Institute-GWAS
catalog, and the Pharmacogenomics Research Network, and a methodological
framework incorporating colocalization analysis, we validated pleiotropy
at the ABCG2 locus between allopurinol response, gout, and serum urate
and identified novel pleiotropy between antihypertensive-induced
new-onset diabetes, Crohn's disease and inflammatory bowel disease at
the IL18RAP/SLC9A4 locus.
Aim: To improve the identification and interpretation of pharmacogenetic
variants through the integration of disease and drug-related traits.
Materials & methods: We hypothesized that integrating genome-wide
disease and pharmacogenomic data may drive new insights into drug
toxicity and response by identifying shared genetic architecture.
Pleiotropic variants were identified using a methodological framework
incorporating colocalization analysis. Results: Using genome-wide
association studies summary statistics from the UK Biobank, European
Bioinformatics Institute-genome-wide association studies catalog and the
Pharmacogenomics Research Network, we validated pleiotropy at the ABCG2
locus between allopurinol response and gout and identified novel
pleiotropy between antihypertensive-induced new-onset diabetes, Crohn's
disease and inflammatory bowel disease at the IL18RAP/SLC9A4 locus.
Conclusion: New mechanistic insights and genetic loci can be uncovered
by identifying pleiotropy between disease and drug-related traits.},
