 abstract = {Identifying rare genetic variants that drive the onset of disease is
challenging, even before considering the additional genetic and
environmental influences that likely exist in complex diseases. We
recently published a study proposing a rare variant in the NR1H3 gene
(p.R415Q, rs61731956) as responsible for the onset of multiple sclerosis
(MS) in two multi-incident families (Wang et al., 2016). This
publication has generated much discussion, and fortunately the
possibility to validate a finding or prove it spurious can occur rapidly
in genetic studies. All novel discoveries must be replicated, and best
efforts should be made to ensure that these replications use the
appropriate samples and approach, and provide the correct interpretation
of the results. This Matters Arising Response paper addresses the
Minikel and MacArthur (2016) and The International Multiple Sclerosis
Genetics Consortium (2016) Matters Arising papers, published
concurrently in Neuron.},
