abstract: Identifying rare genetic variants that drive the onset of disease is challenging,
  even before considering the additional genetic and environmental influences that
  likely exist in complex diseases. We recently published a study proposing a rare
  variant in the NR1H3 gene (p.R415Q, rs61731956) as responsible for the onset of
  multiple sclerosis (MS) in two multi-incident families (Wang et al., 2016). This
  publication has generated much discussion, and fortunately the possibility to validate
  a finding or prove it spurious can occur rapidly in genetic studies. All novel discoveries
  must be replicated, and best efforts should be made to ensure that these replications
  use the appropriate samples and approach, and provide the correct interpretation
  of the results. This Matters Arising Response paper addresses the Minikel and MacArthur
  (2016) and The International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (2016) Matters
  Arising papers, published concurrently in Neuron.
