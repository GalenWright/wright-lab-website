abstract: Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a key enzyme in drug response owing to its
  involvement in the metabolism of similar to 25% of clinically prescribed medications.
  The encoding CYP2D6 gene is highly polymorphic, and many pharmacogenetics studies
  have been performed worldwide to investigate the distribution of CYP2D6 star alleles
  (haplotypes); however, African populations have been relatively understudied to
  date. In this study, the distributions of CYP2D6 star alleles and predicted drug
  metabolizer phenotypes-derived from activity scores-were examined across multiple
  sub-Saharan African populations based on bioinformatics analysis of 961 high-depth
  whole genome sequences. This was followed by characterization of novel star alleles
  and suballeles in a subset of the participants via targeted high-fidelity Single-Molecule
  Real-Time resequencing (Pacific Biosciences). This study revealed varying frequencies
  of known CYP2D6 alleles and predicted phenotypes across different African ethnolinguistic
  groups. Twenty-seven novel CYP2D6 star alleles were predicted computationally and
  two of them were further validated. This study highlights the importance of studying
  variation in key pharmacogenes such as CYP2D6 in the African context to better understand
  population-specific allele frequencies. This will aid in the development of better
  genotyping panels and star allele detection approaches with a view toward supporting
  effective implementation of precision medicine strategies in Africa and across the
  African diaspora.
