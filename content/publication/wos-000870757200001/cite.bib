 abstract = {Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a key enzyme in drug response owing to
its involvement in the metabolism of similar to 25% of clinically
prescribed medications. The encoding CYP2D6 gene is highly polymorphic,
and many pharmacogenetics studies have been performed worldwide to
investigate the distribution of CYP2D6 star alleles (haplotypes);
however, African populations have been relatively understudied to date.
In this study, the distributions of CYP2D6 star alleles and predicted
drug metabolizer phenotypes-derived from activity scores-were examined
across multiple sub-Saharan African populations based on bioinformatics
analysis of 961 high-depth whole genome sequences. This was followed by
characterization of novel star alleles and suballeles in a subset of the
participants via targeted high-fidelity Single-Molecule Real-Time
resequencing (Pacific Biosciences). This study revealed varying
frequencies of known CYP2D6 alleles and predicted phenotypes across
different African ethnolinguistic groups. Twenty-seven novel CYP2D6 star
alleles were predicted computationally and two of them were further
validated. This study highlights the importance of studying variation in
key pharmacogenes such as CYP2D6 in the African context to better
understand population-specific allele frequencies. This will aid in the
development of better genotyping panels and star allele detection
approaches with a view toward supporting effective implementation of
precision medicine strategies in Africa and across the African diaspora.},
