abstract: IntroductionBecause of the unmet needs of current pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia,
  antipsychotic pharmacogenetic research is of utmost importance. However, to date,
  few clinically applicable antipsychotic pharmacogenomic alleles have been identified.
  Nonetheless, next-generation sequencing technologies are expected to aid in the
  identification of clinically significant variants for this complex phenotype. The
  aim of this study was therefore to critically examine the ability of next-generation
  sequencing technologies to reliably detect variation present in pharmacogenes.Materials
  and methodsCandidate antipsychotic pharmacogenes and very important pharmacogenes
  were identified from the literature and the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase. Thereafter,
  the percentage sequence similarity observed between these genes and their corresponding
  pseudogenes and paralogues, as well as the percentage low-complexity sequence and
  GC content of each gene, was calculated. These sequence attributes were subsequently
  compared with the inaccessible' regions of these genes as described by the 1000
  Genomes Project.ResultsIt was found that the percentage inaccessible genome' correlated
  well with GC content (P=9.96x10(-5)), low-complexity sequence (P=0.0002) and the
  presence of pseudogenes/paralogues (P=8.02x10(-7)). In addition, it was found that
  many of the pharmacogenes were not ideally suited to next-generation sequencing
  because of these genomic complexities. These included the CYP and HLA genes, both
  of which are of importance to many fields of pharmacogenetics.ConclusionCurrent
  short read sequencing technologies are unable to comprehensively capture the variation
  in all pharmacogenes. Therefore, until high-throughput sequencing technologies advance
  further, it may be necessary to combine next-generation sequencing with other genotyping
  strategies.
