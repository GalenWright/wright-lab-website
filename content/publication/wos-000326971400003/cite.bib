 abstract = {IntroductionBecause of the unmet needs of current pharmacotherapy for
schizophrenia, antipsychotic pharmacogenetic research is of utmost
importance. However, to date, few clinically applicable antipsychotic
pharmacogenomic alleles have been identified. Nonetheless,
next-generation sequencing technologies are expected to aid in the
identification of clinically significant variants for this complex
phenotype. The aim of this study was therefore to critically examine the
ability of next-generation sequencing technologies to reliably detect
variation present in pharmacogenes.Materials and methodsCandidate
antipsychotic pharmacogenes and very important pharmacogenes were
identified from the literature and the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase.
Thereafter, the percentage sequence similarity observed between these
genes and their corresponding pseudogenes and paralogues, as well as the
percentage low-complexity sequence and GC content of each gene, was
calculated. These sequence attributes were subsequently compared with
the inaccessible' regions of these genes as described by the 1000
Genomes Project.ResultsIt was found that the percentage inaccessible
genome' correlated well with GC content (P=9.96x10(-5)), low-complexity
sequence (P=0.0002) and the presence of pseudogenes/paralogues
(P=8.02x10(-7)). In addition, it was found that many of the
pharmacogenes were not ideally suited to next-generation sequencing
because of these genomic complexities. These included the CYP and HLA
genes, both of which are of importance to many fields of
pharmacogenetics.ConclusionCurrent short read sequencing technologies
are unable to comprehensively capture the variation in all
pharmacogenes. Therefore, until high-throughput sequencing technologies
advance further, it may be necessary to combine next-generation
sequencing with other genotyping strategies.},
