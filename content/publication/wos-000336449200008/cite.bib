 abstract = {Introduction: Large-scale whole genome and exome resequencing studies
have revealed that humans have a high level of deleterious rare
variation, which has important implications for the design of future
pharmacogenetics studies.
Areas covered: Current pharmacogenetic guidelines focus on the
implementation of common variation into dosing guidelines. However, it
is becoming apparent that rare variation may also play an important role
in differential drug response. Current sequencing technologies offer the
opportunity to examine rare variation, but there are many challenges
associated with such analyses. Nonetheless, if a comprehensive picture
of the role that genetic variants play in treatment outcomes is to be
obtained, it will be necessary to include the entire spectrum of
variation, including rare variants, into pharmacogenetic research.
Expert opinion: In order to implement pharmacogenetics in the clinic,
patients should be genotyped for clinically actionable pharmacogenetic
variants and patients responding unfavourably to treatment after
pharmacogenetics-based dosing should be identified and resequenced to
identify additional functionally relevant variants, including rare
variants. All derived information should be added to a central database
to allow for the updating of existing dosing guidelines. By routinely
implementing such strategies, pharmacogenetics-based treatment
guidelines will continue to improve.},
