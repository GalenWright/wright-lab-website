abstract: 'Introduction: Large-scale whole genome and exome resequencing studies have
  revealed that humans have a high level of deleterious rare variation, which has
  important implications for the design of future pharmacogenetics studies. Areas
  covered: Current pharmacogenetic guidelines focus on the implementation of common
  variation into dosing guidelines. However, it is becoming apparent that rare variation
  may also play an important role in differential drug response. Current sequencing
  technologies offer the opportunity to examine rare variation, but there are many
  challenges associated with such analyses. Nonetheless, if a comprehensive picture
  of the role that genetic variants play in treatment outcomes is to be obtained,
  it will be necessary to include the entire spectrum of variation, including rare
  variants, into pharmacogenetic research. Expert opinion: In order to implement pharmacogenetics
  in the clinic, patients should be genotyped for clinically actionable pharmacogenetic
  variants and patients responding unfavourably to treatment after pharmacogenetics-based
  dosing should be identified and resequenced to identify additional functionally
  relevant variants, including rare variants. All derived information should be added
  to a central database to allow for the updating of existing dosing guidelines. By
  routinely implementing such strategies, pharmacogenetics-based treatment guidelines
  will continue to improve.'
