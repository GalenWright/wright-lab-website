 abstract = {Polygenic scores (PGSs) have emerged as promising tools for complex
trait risk prediction. The application of these scores to
pharmacogenomics provides new opportunities to improve the prediction of
treatment outcomes. To gain insight into this area of research, we
conducted a systematic review and accompanying analysis. This review
uncovered 51 papers examining the use of PGSs for drug-related outcomes,
with the majority of these papers focusing on the treatment of
psychiatric disorders (n = 30). Due to difficulties in collecting large
cohorts of uniformly treated patients, the majority of pharmacogenomic
PGSs were derived from large-scale genome-wide association studies of
disease phenotypes that were related to the pharmacogenomic phenotypes
under investigation (e.g., schizophrenia-derived PGSs for antipsychotic
response prediction). Examination of the research participants included
in these studies revealed that the majority of cohort participants were
of European descent (78.4%). These biases were also reflected in
research affiliations, which were heavily weighted towards institutions
located in Europe and North America, with no first or last authors
originating from institutions in Africa or South Asia. There was also
substantial variability in the methods used to develop PGSs, with
between 3 and 6.6 million variants included in the PGSs. Finally, we
observed significant inconsistencies in the reporting of PGS analyses
and results, particularly in terms of risk model development and
application, coupled with a lack of data transparency and availability,
with only three pharmacogenomics PGSs deposited on the Polygenic Score
Catalog. These findings highlight current gaps and key areas for future
pharmacogenomic PGS research.},
