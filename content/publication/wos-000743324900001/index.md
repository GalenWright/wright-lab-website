abstract: Polygenic scores (PGSs) have emerged as promising tools for complex trait
  risk prediction. The application of these scores to pharmacogenomics provides new
  opportunities to improve the prediction of treatment outcomes. To gain insight into
  this area of research, we conducted a systematic review and accompanying analysis.
  This review uncovered 51 papers examining the use of PGSs for drug-related outcomes,
  with the majority of these papers focusing on the treatment of psychiatric disorders
  (n = 30). Due to difficulties in collecting large cohorts of uniformly treated patients,
  the majority of pharmacogenomic PGSs were derived from large-scale genome-wide association
  studies of disease phenotypes that were related to the pharmacogenomic phenotypes
  under investigation (e.g., schizophrenia-derived PGSs for antipsychotic response
  prediction). Examination of the research participants included in these studies
  revealed that the majority of cohort participants were of European descent (78.4%).
  These biases were also reflected in research affiliations, which were heavily weighted
  towards institutions located in Europe and North America, with no first or last
  authors originating from institutions in Africa or South Asia. There was also substantial
  variability in the methods used to develop PGSs, with between 3 and 6.6 million
  variants included in the PGSs. Finally, we observed significant inconsistencies
  in the reporting of PGS analyses and results, particularly in terms of risk model
  development and application, coupled with a lack of data transparency and availability,
  with only three pharmacogenomics PGSs deposited on the Polygenic Score Catalog.
  These findings highlight current gaps and key areas for future pharmacogenomic PGS
  research.
