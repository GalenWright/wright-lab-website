abstract: ObjectiveTo characterize, among European and Han Chinese populations, the
  genetic predictors of maculopapular exanthema (MPE), a cutaneous adverse drug reaction
  common to antiepileptic drugs.MethodsWe conducted a case-control genome-wide association
  study of autosomal genotypes, including Class I and II human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
  alleles, in 323 cases and 1,321 drug-tolerant controls from epilepsy cohorts of
  northern European and Han Chinese descent. Results from each cohort were meta-analyzed.ResultsWe
  report an association between a rare variant in the complement factor H-related
  4 (CFHR4) gene and phenytoin-induced MPE in Europeans (p = 4.5 x 10(-11); odds ratio
  [95% confidence interval] 7 [3.2-16]). This variant is in complete linkage disequilibrium
  with a missense variant (N1050Y) in the complement factor H (CFH) gene. In addition,
  our results reinforce the association between HLA-A*31:01 and carbamazepine hypersensitivity.
  We did not identify significant genetic associations with MPE among Han Chinese
  patients.ConclusionsThe identification of genetic predictors of MPE in CFHR4 and
  CFH, members of the complement factor H-related protein family, suggest a new link
  between regulation of the complement system alternative pathway and phenytoin-induced
  hypersensitivity in European-ancestral patients.
