 abstract = {Huntington disease (HD) is the most common monogenic neurodegenerative
disorder in populations of European ancestry, but occurs at lower
prevalence in populations of East Asian or black African descent. New
mutations for HD result from CAG repeat expansions of intermediate
alleles (IAs), usually of paternal origin. The differing prevalence of
HD may be related to the rate of new mutations in a population, but no
comparative estimates of IA frequency or the HD new mutation rate are
available. In this study, we characterize IA frequency and the CAG
repeat distribution in fifteen populations of diverse ethnic origin. We
estimate the HD new mutation rate in a series of populations using
molecular IA expansion rates. The frequency of IAs was highest in
Hispanic Americans and Northern Europeans, and lowest in black Africans
and East Asians. The prevalence of HD correlated with the frequency of
IAs by population and with the proportion of IAs found on the
HD-associated A1 haplotype. The HD new mutation rate was estimated to be
highest in populations with the highest frequency of IAs. In European
ancestry populations, one in 5,372 individuals from the general
population and 7.1% of individuals with an expanded CAG repeat in the
HD range are estimated to have a molecular new mutation. Our data
suggest that the new mutation rate for HD varies substantially between
populations, and that IA frequency and haplotype are closely linked to
observed epidemiological differences in the prevalence of HD across
major ancestry groups in different countries.},
