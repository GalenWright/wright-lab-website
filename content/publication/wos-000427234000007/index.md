abstract: Huntington disease (HD) is the most common monogenic neurodegenerative disorder
  in populations of European ancestry, but occurs at lower prevalence in populations
  of East Asian or black African descent. New mutations for HD result from CAG repeat
  expansions of intermediate alleles (IAs), usually of paternal origin. The differing
  prevalence of HD may be related to the rate of new mutations in a population, but
  no comparative estimates of IA frequency or the HD new mutation rate are available.
  In this study, we characterize IA frequency and the CAG repeat distribution in fifteen
  populations of diverse ethnic origin. We estimate the HD new mutation rate in a
  series of populations using molecular IA expansion rates. The frequency of IAs was
  highest in Hispanic Americans and Northern Europeans, and lowest in black Africans
  and East Asians. The prevalence of HD correlated with the frequency of IAs by population
  and with the proportion of IAs found on the HD-associated A1 haplotype. The HD new
  mutation rate was estimated to be highest in populations with the highest frequency
  of IAs. In European ancestry populations, one in 5,372 individuals from the general
  population and 7.1% of individuals with an expanded CAG repeat in the HD range are
  estimated to have a molecular new mutation. Our data suggest that the new mutation
  rate for HD varies substantially between populations, and that IA frequency and
  haplotype are closely linked to observed epidemiological differences in the prevalence
  of HD across major ancestry groups in different countries.
