abstract: Despite changes in guideline-based management of moderate/severe traumatic
  brain injury (TBI) over the preceding decades, little impact on mortality and morbidity
  have been seen. This argues against the ``one-treatment fits all″ approach to such
  management strategies. With this, some preliminary advances in the area of personalized
  medicine in TBI care have displayed promising results. However, to continue transitioning
  toward individually-tailored care, we require integration of complex ``-omics″ data
  sets. The past few decades have seen dramatic increases in the volume of complex
  multi-modal data in moderate and severe TBI care. Such data includes serial high-fidelity
  multi-modal characterization of the cerebral physiome, serum/cerebrospinal fluid
  proteomics, admission genetic profiles, and serial advanced neuroimaging modalities.
  Integrating these complex and serially obtained data sets, with patient baseline
  demographics, treatment information and clinical outcomes over time, can be a daunting
  task for the treating clinician. Within this review, we highlight the current status
  of such multi-modal omics data sets in moderate/severe TBI, current limitations
  to the utilization of such data, and a potential path forward through employing
  integrative neuroinformatic approaches, which are applied in other neuropathologies.
  Such advances are positioned to facilitate the transition to precision prognostication
  and inform a top-down approach to the development of personalized therapeutics in
  moderate/severe TBI.</p>
