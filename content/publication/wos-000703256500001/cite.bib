 abstract = {Despite changes in guideline-based management of moderate/severe
traumatic brain injury (TBI) over the preceding decades, little impact
on mortality and morbidity have been seen. This argues against the
``one-treatment fits all″ approach to such management strategies.
With this, some preliminary advances in the area of personalized
medicine in TBI care have displayed promising results. However, to
continue transitioning toward individually-tailored care, we require
integration of complex ``-omics″ data sets. The past few decades have
seen dramatic increases in the volume of complex multi-modal data in
moderate and severe TBI care. Such data includes serial high-fidelity
multi-modal characterization of the cerebral physiome,
serum/cerebrospinal fluid proteomics, admission genetic profiles, and
serial advanced neuroimaging modalities. Integrating these complex and
serially obtained data sets, with patient baseline demographics,
treatment information and clinical outcomes over time, can be a daunting
task for the treating clinician. Within this review, we highlight the
current status of such multi-modal omics data sets in moderate/severe
TBI, current limitations to the utilization of such data, and a
potential path forward through employing integrative neuroinformatic
approaches, which are applied in other neuropathologies. Such advances
are positioned to facilitate the transition to precision prognostication
and inform a top-down approach to the development of personalized
therapeutics in moderate/severe TBI.</p>},
