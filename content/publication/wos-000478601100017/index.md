abstract: Cisplatin is a highly effective chemotherapeutic. Unfortunately, its use
  is limited by cisplatin-induced ototoxicity (CIO). Substantial research has been
  performed to uncover the genetic variants associated with CIO; however, there has
  been a lack of consistency in the results that have been reported. This paper aims
  to provide an overview of the current state of CIO genomics research, delving into
  the shortcomings of past research, and providing recommendations for future avenues
  of study.
