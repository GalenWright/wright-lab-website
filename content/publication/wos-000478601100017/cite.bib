 abstract = {Cisplatin is a highly effective chemotherapeutic. Unfortunately, its use
is limited by cisplatin-induced ototoxicity (CIO). Substantial research
has been performed to uncover the genetic variants associated with CIO;
however, there has been a lack of consistency in the results that have
been reported. This paper aims to provide an overview of the current
state of CIO genomics research, delving into the shortcomings of past
research, and providing recommendations for future avenues of study.},
