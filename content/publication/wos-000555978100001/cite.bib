 abstract = {Genetic variation in genes encoding cytochromeP450enzymes has important
clinical implications for drug metabolism. Bioinformatics algorithms for
genotyping these highly polymorphic genes using high-throughput sequence
data and automating phenotype prediction have recently been developed.
TheCYP2D6gene is often used as a model during the validation of these
algorithms due to its clinical importance, high polymorphism, and
structural variations. However, the validation process is often limited
to common star alleles due to scarcity of reference datasets. In
addition, there has been no comprehensive benchmark of these algorithms
to date. We performed a systematic comparison of three star allele
calling algorithms using 4618 simulations as well as 75 whole-genome
sequence samples from the GeT-RM project. Overall, we found that Aldy
and Astrolabe are better suited to call both common and rare diplotypes
compared to Stargazer, which is affected by population structure. Aldy
was the best performing algorithm in callingCYP2D6structural variants
followed by Stargazer, whereas Astrolabe had limitations especially in
calling hybrid rearrangements. We found that ensemble genotyping,
characterised by taking a consensus of genotypes called by all three
algorithms, has higher haplotype concordance but it is prone to
ambiguities whenever complete discrepancies between the tools arise.
Further, we evaluated the effects of sequencing coverage and indel
misalignment on genotyping accuracy. Our account of the strengths and
limitations of these algorithms is extremely important to clinicians and
researchers in the pharmacogenomics and precision medicine communities
looking to haplotypeCYP2D6and other pharmacogenes using high-throughput
sequencing data.},
