 abstract = {Bioinformatics pipelines for calling star alleles (haplotypes) in
cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes are important for the implementation of
precision medicine. Genotyping CYP genes using high throughput
sequencing data is complicated, e.g., by being highly polymorphic, not
to mention the structural variations especially in CYP2D6, CYP2A6, and
CYP2B6. Genome graph-based variant detection approaches have been shown
to be reliable for genotyping HLA alleles. However, their application to
enhancing star allele calling in CYP genes has not been extensively
explored. We present StellarPGx, a Nextflow pipeline for accurately
genotyping CYP genes by combining genome graph-based variant detection,
read coverage information from the original reference-based alignments,
and combinatorial diplotype assignments. The implementation of
StellarPGx using Nextflow facilitates its portability, reproducibility,
and scalability on various user platforms. StellarPGx is currently able
to genotype 12 important pharmacogenes belonging to the CYP1, 2, and 3
families. For purposes of validation, we use CYP2D6 as a model gene
owing to its high degree of polymorphisms (over 130 star alleles defined
to date, including complex structural variants) and clinical importance.
We applied StellarPGx and three existing callers to 109 whole genome
sequenced samples for which the Genetic Testing Reference Material
Coordination Program (GeT-RM) has recently provided consensus truth
CYP2D6 diplotypes. StellarPGx had the highest CYP2D6 diplotype
concordance (99%) with GeT-RM compared with Cyrius (98%), Aldy (82%),
and Stargazer (84%). This exemplifies the high accuracy of StellarPGx
and highlights its importance for both research and clinical
pharmacogenomics applications. The StellarPGx pipeline is open-source
and available from .},
