 abstract = {Background: Ondansetron is a highly effective antiemetic for the
treatment of nausea and vomiting. However, this medication has also been
associated with QT prolongation. Pharmacogenomic information on
therapeutic response to ondansetron exists, but no investigation has
been performed on genetic factors that influence the cardiac safety of
this medication.
Methods: Three patient groups receiving ondansetron were recruited and
followed prospectively (pediatric postsurgical patients n = 101;
pediatric oncology patients n = 98; pregnant women n = 62).
Electrocardiograms were conducted at baseline, and 5- and 30-min
post-ondansetron administration, to determine the effect of ondansetron
treatment on QT interval. Pharmacogenomic associations were assessed via
analyses of comprehensive CYP2D6 genotyping and genome-wide association
study data.
Results: In the entire cohort, 62 patients (24.1%) met the criteria for
prolonged QT, with 1.2% of the cohort exhibiting unsafe QT
prolongation. The most significant shift from baseline occurred at five
minutes postondansetron administration (P = 9.8 x 10(-4)). CYP2D6
activity score was not associated with prolonged QT. Genome-wide
analyses identified novel associations with a missense variant in TLR3
(rs3775291; P = 2.00 x 10(-7)) and a variant linked to the expression of
SLC36A1 (rs34124313; P = 1.97 x 10(-7)).
Conclusions: This study has provided insight into the genomic basis of
ondansetron-induced cardiac changes and has emphasized the importance of
genes that have been implicated in serotonin-related traits. These
biologically-relevant findings represent the first step towards
understanding this adverse event with the overall goal to improve the
safety of this commonly used antiemetic medication.},
