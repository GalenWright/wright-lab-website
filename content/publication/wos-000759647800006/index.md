abstract: 'Background: Ondansetron is a highly effective antiemetic for the treatment
  of nausea and vomiting. However, this medication has also been associated with QT
  prolongation. Pharmacogenomic information on therapeutic response to ondansetron
  exists, but no investigation has been performed on genetic factors that influence
  the cardiac safety of this medication. Methods: Three patient groups receiving ondansetron
  were recruited and followed prospectively (pediatric postsurgical patients n = 101;
  pediatric oncology patients n = 98; pregnant women n = 62). Electrocardiograms were
  conducted at baseline, and 5- and 30-min post-ondansetron administration, to determine
  the effect of ondansetron treatment on QT interval. Pharmacogenomic associations
  were assessed via analyses of comprehensive CYP2D6 genotyping and genome-wide association
  study data. Results: In the entire cohort, 62 patients (24.1%) met the criteria
  for prolonged QT, with 1.2% of the cohort exhibiting unsafe QT prolongation. The
  most significant shift from baseline occurred at five minutes postondansetron administration
  (P = 9.8 x 10(-4)). CYP2D6 activity score was not associated with prolonged QT.
  Genome-wide analyses identified novel associations with a missense variant in TLR3
  (rs3775291; P = 2.00 x 10(-7)) and a variant linked to the expression of SLC36A1
  (rs34124313; P = 1.97 x 10(-7)). Conclusions: This study has provided insight into
  the genomic basis of ondansetron-induced cardiac changes and has emphasized the
  importance of genes that have been implicated in serotonin-related traits. These
  biologically-relevant findings represent the first step towards understanding this
  adverse event with the overall goal to improve the safety of this commonly used
  antiemetic medication.'
