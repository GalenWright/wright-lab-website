abstract: Long-term exposure to efavirenz (EFV) measured in hair samples may predict
  response to antiretroviral treatment (ART). Polymorphisms in CYP2B6 are known to
  alter EFV levels. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between CYP2B6
  genotype, EFV levels measured in hair, and virological outcomes on ART in a real-world
  setting. We measured EFV levels in hair from HIV-positive South African females
  who had been receiving EFV-based treatment for at least 3 months from the South
  African Black (SAB) (n=81) and Cape Mixed Ancestry (CMA) (n=53) populations. Common
  genetic variation in CYP2B6 was determined in 15 individuals from each population
  using bidirectional Sanger sequencing. Prioritized variants (n=16) were subsequently
  genotyped in the entire patient cohort (n=134). The predictive value of EFV levels
  in hair and selected variants in CYP2B6 on virological treatment outcomes was assessed.
  Previously described alleles (CYP2B6*2, CYP2B6*5, CYP2B6*6, CYP2B6*17, and CYP2B6*18),
  as well as two novel alleles (CYP2B6*31 and CYP2B6*32), were detected in this study.
  Compared to noncarriers, individuals homozygous for CYP2B6*6 had approximate to
  109% increased EFV levels in hair (p=.016) and CYP2B6*18 heterozygotes demonstrated
  82% higher EFV hair levels (p=.0006). This study confirmed that alleles affecting
  CYP2B6 metabolism and subsequent EFV exposure are present at significant frequencies
  in both the SAB and CMA populations. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the
  use of hair samples for testing EFV concentrations may be a useful tool in determining
  long-term drug exposure in resource-limited countries.
