 abstract = {Long-term exposure to efavirenz (EFV) measured in hair samples may
predict response to antiretroviral treatment (ART). Polymorphisms in
CYP2B6 are known to alter EFV levels. The aim of this study was to
assess the relationship between CYP2B6 genotype, EFV levels measured in
hair, and virological outcomes on ART in a real-world setting. We
measured EFV levels in hair from HIV-positive South African females who
had been receiving EFV-based treatment for at least 3 months from the
South African Black (SAB) (n=81) and Cape Mixed Ancestry (CMA) (n=53)
populations. Common genetic variation in CYP2B6 was determined in 15
individuals from each population using bidirectional Sanger sequencing.
Prioritized variants (n=16) were subsequently genotyped in the entire
patient cohort (n=134). The predictive value of EFV levels in hair and
selected variants in CYP2B6 on virological treatment outcomes was
assessed. Previously described alleles (CYP2B6*2, CYP2B6*5,
CYP2B6*6, CYP2B6*17, and CYP2B6*18), as well as two novel alleles
(CYP2B6*31 and CYP2B6*32), were detected in this study. Compared to
noncarriers, individuals homozygous for CYP2B6*6 had approximate to
109% increased EFV levels in hair (p=.016) and CYP2B6*18
heterozygotes demonstrated 82% higher EFV hair levels (p=.0006). This
study confirmed that alleles affecting CYP2B6 metabolism and subsequent
EFV exposure are present at significant frequencies in both the SAB and
CMA populations. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the use of
hair samples for testing EFV concentrations may be a useful tool in
determining long-term drug exposure in resource-limited countries.},
