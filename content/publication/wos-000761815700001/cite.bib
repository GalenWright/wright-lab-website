 abstract = {Background & Aims According to pivotal clinical trials, cure rates for
sofosbuvir-based antiviral therapy exceed 96%. Treatment failure is
usually assumed to be because of virological resistance-associated
substitutions or clinical risk factors, yet the role of patient-specific
genetic factors has not been well explored. We determined if
patient-specific genetic factors help predict patients likely to fail
sofosbuvir treatment in real-world treatment situations. Methods We
recruited sofosbuvir-treated patients with chronic hepatitis C from five
Canadian treatment sites, and performed a case-control pharmacogenomics
study assessing both previously published and novel genetic
polymorphisms. Specifically studied were variants predicted to impair
CES1-dependent production of sofosbuvir's active metabolite,
interferon-lambda signalling variants expected to impact a patient's
immune response to the virus and an HLA variant associated with
increased spontaneous and treatment-induced viral clearance. Results
Three hundred and fifty-nine sofosbuvir-treated patients were available
for analyses after exclusions, with 34 (9.5%) failing treatment. We
identified CES1 variants as novel predictors for treatment failure in
European patients (rs115629050 or rs4513095; odds ratio (OR): 5.43; 95%
confidence interval (CI): 1.64-18.01; P = .0057), replicated
associations with IFNL4 variants predicted to increase interferon-lambda
signalling (eg rs12979860; OR: 2.25; 95% CI: 1.25-4.06; P = .0071) and
discovered a novel association with a coding variant predicted to
enhance the activity of IFNL4's receptor (rs2834167 in IL10RB; OR: 1.81;
95% CI: 1.01-3.24; P = .047). Conclusions Ultimately, this work
demonstrates that patient-specific genetic factors could be used as a
tool to identify patients at higher risk of treatment failure and allow
for these patients to receive effective therapy sooner.},
