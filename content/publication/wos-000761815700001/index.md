abstract: "Background & Aims According to pivotal clinical trials, cure rates for\
  \ sofosbuvir-based antiviral therapy exceed 96%. Treatment failure is usually assumed\
  \ to be because of virological resistance-associated substitutions or clinical risk\
  \ factors, yet the role of patient-specific genetic factors has not been well explored.\
  \ We determined if patient-specific genetic factors help predict patients likely\
  \ to fail sofosbuvir treatment in real-world treatment situations. Methods We recruited\
  \ sofosbuvir-treated patients with chronic hepatitis C from five Canadian treatment\
  \ sites, and performed a case-control pharmacogenomics study assessing both previously\
  \ published and novel genetic polymorphisms. Specifically studied were variants\
  \ predicted to impair CES1-dependent production of sofosbuvir's active metabolite,\
  \ interferon-lambda signalling variants expected to impact a patient's immune response\
  \ to the virus and an HLA variant associated with increased spontaneous and treatment-induced\
  \ viral clearance. Results Three hundred and fifty-nine sofosbuvir-treated patients\
  \ were available for analyses after exclusions, with 34 (9.5%) failing treatment.\
  \ We identified CES1 variants as novel predictors for treatment failure in European\
  \ patients (rs115629050 or rs4513095; odds ratio (OR): 5.43; 95% confidence interval\
  \ (CI): 1.64-18.01; P = .0057), replicated associations with IFNL4 variants predicted\
  \ to increase interferon-lambda signalling (eg rs12979860; OR: 2.25; 95% CI: 1.25-4.06;\
  \ P = .0071) and discovered a novel association with a coding variant predicted\
  \ to enhance the activity of IFNL4's receptor (rs2834167 in IL10RB; OR: 1.81; 95%\
  \ CI: 1.01-3.24; P = .047). Conclusions Ultimately, this work demonstrates that\
  \ patient-specific genetic factors could be used as a tool to identify patients\
  \ at higher risk of treatment failure and allow for these patients to receive effective\
  \ therapy sooner."
