abstract: The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is an attractive schizophrenia
  candidate gene, encoding a catabolic dopamine enzyme. The enzyme exists as two distinct
  isoforms, with the membrane bound enzyme (i.e. MB-COMT) being predominantly expressed
  in the brain. Since African populations remain underrepresented in genetic/genomic
  research, we performed an association study to determine whether MB-COMT genetic
  variants are associated with schizophrenia-susceptibility and symptom severity in
  the South African Xhosa population. Fourteen candidate polymorphisms were selected
  by means of a literature search and in silico analyses and were subsequently genotyped
  in a cohort of 238 Xhosa schizophrenia patients and 240 healthy Xhosa controls.
  Genetic association was tested with schizophrenia-susceptibility as well as symptom
  severity within the patient group. Polymorphisms of interest were also analysed
  using functional assays. Two SNPs, rs2020917 (OR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.37-0.79; P = 0.0011)
  and rs737865 (OR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.36-0.74; P = 0.0002), in the P2 promoter region
  were significantly associated with schizophrenia as well as an increase (increase
  = 11.2%, 95% CI 3.7%-19.2%; P = 0.0031) in reporter gene expression. The minor alleles
  of these SNPs were underrepresented in the schizophrenia cohort, indicating a possible
  protective effect. The P2 region also formed part of a haplotype found to be associated
  with the severity of the negative symptoms of the disorder. The data generated by
  this study indicate that genetic variation of MB-COMT could be associated with schizophrenia
  and negative symptom severity in the Xhosa population and may therefore be one of
  the genomic loci contributing towards the disorder in the South African community.
  Future large-scale studies in other African schizophrenia populations are required
  to further elucidate the significance of these findings. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
