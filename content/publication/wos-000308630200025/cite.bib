 abstract = {The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is an attractive
schizophrenia candidate gene, encoding a catabolic dopamine enzyme. The
enzyme exists as two distinct isoforms, with the membrane bound enzyme
(i.e. MB-COMT) being predominantly expressed in the brain. Since African
populations remain underrepresented in genetic/genomic research, we
performed an association study to determine whether MB-COMT genetic
variants are associated with schizophrenia-susceptibility and symptom
severity in the South African Xhosa population.
Fourteen candidate polymorphisms were selected by means of a literature
search and in silico analyses and were subsequently genotyped in a
cohort of 238 Xhosa schizophrenia patients and 240 healthy Xhosa
controls. Genetic association was tested with
schizophrenia-susceptibility as well as symptom severity within the
patient group. Polymorphisms of interest were also analysed using
functional assays.
Two SNPs, rs2020917 (OR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.37-0.79; P = 0.0011) and
rs737865 (OR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.36-0.74; P = 0.0002), in the P2 promoter
region were significantly associated with schizophrenia as well as an
increase (increase = 11.2%, 95% CI 3.7%-19.2%; P = 0.0031) in
reporter gene expression. The minor alleles of these SNPs were
underrepresented in the schizophrenia cohort, indicating a possible
protective effect. The P2 region also formed part of a haplotype found
to be associated with the severity of the negative symptoms of the
disorder.
The data generated by this study indicate that genetic variation of
MB-COMT could be associated with schizophrenia and negative symptom
severity in the Xhosa population and may therefore be one of the genomic
loci contributing towards the disorder in the South African community.
Future large-scale studies in other African schizophrenia populations
are required to further elucidate the significance of these findings.
