Genetic variants that alter the clinical expression of disease-causing mutations are known as genetic modifiers and can help explain differences in disease outcomes. For example, genetic variants in genes from DNA repair pathways influence age-of-onset for several neurological diseases.

We use large-scale bioinformatic analyses to inform functional genomic experiments. This includes using gene editing and human stem-cell-derived neural models to study genetic modifiers of neurological disorders. 

Insights obtained from our research can lead to a better understanding of human biology, the identification of therapeutic targets, and improved risk prediction models.

<span style="color:#7BAFD4">**Territory acknowledgement**: *Our research group is located on the original lands of Anishinaabeg, Cree, Oji-Cree, Dakota and Dene peoples, and on the homeland of the MÃ©tis Nation. We respect the Treaties that were made on these territories, we acknowledge the harms and mistakes of the past, and we dedicate ourselves to moving forward in partnership with Indigenous communities in a spirit of reconciliation and collaboration.*</span>
